BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT:\\nFinancial year 2019-20 has seen it all, from the markets reaching its all-time high to three-year returns being erased within a span of a \\nmonth. This year we saw the GDP touching its lowest level in seven years while crude oil fell to levels last seen about 18 years back. The \\nbiggest shock came at the end of the year, the COVID-19 global pandemic on a scale that’s seen once in a lifetime.\\nOverall, the NIFTY delivered negative returns of around 26% for FY19-20. Midcaps and Smallcaps that had started outperforming largecaps \\nby early 2020, gave away all the outperformance and underperformed the largecap indices. When compared to other emerging markets, \\nIndia was a stark underperformer with MSCI India delivering negative returns of nearly 32% (in US$ terms) compared with MSCI Emerging \\nMarket Index’s -20%.',\n",
              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED6\\nThe fiscal year had started on a positive note helped by a strong political mandate at the center and India being a natural hedge against \\nthe adverse growth impact of US-China trade war. The full majority to BJP led NDA government reinforced the belief in some of the \\npolicies undertaken during their last term; particularly the actions to keep the inflation contained and focus on social security net.  \\nHowever, the slowing economic growth (4.7% in Q3 FY20), the slowest in almost 7 years, and stress in the non-banking financial entities \\nkept the markets jittery. The sharp economic slowdown necessitated policy action at a war scale. The Government responded with big \\nbang reforms on corporate taxes, which boosted market sentiment.  Further, India being integrated with the rest of the world was also \\nimpacted a bit by slowing global growth. \\nDespite a backdrop of weak economic growth, the Indian markets hit fresh highs in early 2020 on expectations of economic recovery. Both \\nservice sector and manufacturing sector PMIs had started looking up. Even the IIP numbers suggested that the economy was turning in \\nthe Jan-Feb 2020 period. However, the recovery was cut short by the sudden outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic.\\nMarkets plummeted consequently in line with the global markets, reacting as much to the lockdown and its economic fallout as to the \\npandemic itself. FPIs (Foreign Portfolio Investors) that had positive inflows for most part of the financial year, sold nearly US$ 8.3bn worth \\nof equities in March alone even as DIIs bought US$ 7.5bn. For the full financial year, FPIs were net buyers to the tune of US$ 1.3 billion \\nin equities. \\nThere will be economic consequences as the world deals with triple shocks simultaneously- supply shock, demand shock, and oil shock \\n(as oil prices plunged after the disagreement between OPEC nations on cutting down of oil supply). Aggressive policy intervention will \\nbe critical in limiting the damage.\\nThe government announced a ` 1.7 trillion stimulus aimed at easing the bottom of the pyramid through the lockdown. At 0.8% of GDP \\nthis would be modest compared to several other countries that have undertaken much larger stimuli; the US for example has approved a \\npackage which is 10% of their GDP. We hope that on the other side of the lockdown, there will be more help from the government. The \\npain that several businesses, especially smaller ones, face around their very survival and the corresponding rise in unemployment, need \\nto be addressed. While poverty in India has usually been associated with rural India, this crisis has brought to fore the plight of the urban \\npoor, who will need focused support as unemployment situation continues to worsen.\\nOn the fixed income markets side, the market rallied in the initial months of the financial year with the budget adhering to fiscal \\nconsolidation, global developments tilting towards monetary easing, accommodative RBI policy on the backdrop of slowing economic \\ngrowth and surplus systemic liquidity. \\nThe bond market remained volatile for the remaining part of the year on concerns about the prospects of fiscal slippage due to tax cut \\nannouncement and on the prospects of additional fiscal stimulus measures given the economic slowdown. With hike in the near-term CPI, \\nRBI kept the policy action on hold post the October 2019 policy and resorted to unconventional actions to ensure that term premiums \\nreduce. These measures were intended to bring down sovereign rates and thereby enable better transmission in the corporate markets \\nover time. \\nLiquidity conditions remained in surplus all through the second half of the financial year, with the effective overnight rates trading \\nsubstantially below the policy rate in all the secured overnight funding markets. The onset of market volatility post the large scale spread \\nof the Covid-19 pandemic across the globe rattled domestic debt markets as large scale FPI outflows were witnessed. \\nThe RBI advanced its scheduled April review and announced an out of schedule policy Repo rate cut by 75bps to 4.40%.

Our focus on investor education initiatives this year was to educate potential investors and savers, including in B30 locations, \\non how mutual funds can act as solutions for their financial goals. We used different communication, advertising and thought-leadership \\nplatforms to engage with them. We continue to believe; this is the way ahead for the industry as we see different customer niches and \\nneeds emerge.\\nThe major investor awareness activities undertaken by us during the year are mentioned as under:\\n1. Development and Dissemination of Investor Education material \\na. Articles – This year we partnered with the India Today Group for a series of investor education articles on different areas of \\npersonal finance, investing and mutual funds. A separate section has been created in the English & Hindi editions of their \\nIndia Today magazine called ‘Nivesh Yatra – The Journey towards Financial Freedom’ for this initiative which publishes articles \\nfor their readers. In addition, we developed brochures from in-house content like ‘Planning for Retirement’ and ’14 Reasons \\nto fall in love with Mutual Funds’ to promote the effectiveness of mutual funds as an investment solution. The content when \\nrequired, is adapted to formats like online mailers/WhatsApp and is circulated to investors and distribution partners alike and \\nhosted on our website blog - Inspire.  ',\n",
              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED10\\nb. Videos – We worked with content partners to develop videos on hybrid funds and benefits of staying invested. The video \\ntitled ‘Bumpy Ride’ highlights the benefits of staying invested despite ups and downs in market conditions while the second \\nvideo titled “H itesh Ritesh” shows the investment journey of two friends where one chooses to stay invested during volatile \\nmarkets and reaches his financial goals, while the other friend chooses to opt out during tough market conditions. Their \\njourney is beautifully showcased lyrically. We also developed a light-hearted video on Children’s Day with two child artists who \\nare curious to know about things in their surroundings. The message that we wanted to convey was as an investor you must \\nhave many queries about your investments and mutual funds could be an answer for the same. All videos were promoted \\nthrough our social media channels.\\n2. Social Media – Our objective\\xa0on social media\\xa0is to drive more engagement on our\\xa0official social handles by using an approach of \\nunique content, rich formats, and engaging representation.\\xa0Following this approach, we have run quite a few quiz\\xa0series under \\nthe name #SBIMFQuizTime on\\xa0Twitter with an intention to engage with our existing and potential followers\\xa0on different aspects \\nof mutual funds and financial planning.\\xa0We also did some topical content on festivals and occasion such as:\\n a.

Women’s Day -\\xa0Creatives targeting a Homemaker, Working women and Women entrepreneur\\n Other than this we continue to reach out to audiences with various posts on SIP, Equity Investing through Mutual Funds, Fixed \\nMaturity Plans, Use of Systematic Withdrawal Plans for regular\\xa0cash flow\\xa0for expenses and more. Our community on social media \\nplatforms like Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter has crossed over seven lakh followers\\xa0and continues to grow. \\xa0\\xa0\\n3. Online\\xa0Marketing\\xa0–\\xa0We continue to focus on reaching out to millennials who are increasingly preferring a digital experience over \\nthe traditional. One of our investor awareness initiatives of the year was\\xa0#WhatsYourExcuse, aimed at those\\xa0audiences who keep \\ndelaying their investments\\xa0due to various reasons. Concepts like\\xa0online\\xa0investing and\\xa0possibility to register\\xa0SIP\\xa0even when on \\na\\xa0holiday\\xa0online/via an app were specifically made for them.\\xa0\\xa0In addition, we continuously promote concepts\\xa0like SIP,\\xa0Goal-based \\ninvesting through mutual funds\\xa0and ELSS (ELSS means LESS tax) through\\xa0prominent\\xa0domain and finance\\xa0sites like Café Mutual, \\nMorningstar India, Value Research and distribution-led sites like AdvisorKhoj. These activities are supplemented with\\xa0organic and \\naffiliate\\xa0email campaigns which\\xa0help in reach and awareness to a large group of online audiences.\\n4. Public Relations/Media – With the evolving media consumption habits, interaction across social media, print publications, and \\nonline media remains important. We continue to reach out to key media including regional (Newspapers, Magazines, Online and \\nTelevision) to establish thought leadership by getting relevant coverage in large format industry stories, authored articles and Q&A’s \\nwith spokespersons covering business, funds and investment and investor awareness aspects. We also continued to have a sustained \\nfocus on reaching out to potential investors through regional media sharing concepts for investor awareness like our ‘Nivesh Ke \\nNuske’ section in magazines like ‘Nivesh Manthan’\\xa0and highlighting the benefits of mutual funds, financial planning and other \\naspects of personal finance.\\xa0 \\xa0\\n5. Television & On-ground Events – Our association with CNBC Awaaz, a leading Hindi business channel from the CNBC-TV18 network, \\nfor Pehla Kadam – Season 5, a holistic investor education initiative across India, continued this year with an exclusive tie-up to \\npromote mutual funds as an investment option for financial goals. This included a mix of on-ground events, in-studio discussions, \\ncorporate campus events and online/social media. As part of the sponsorship, we plan to have 15 episodes (10 in-studio discussions \\nand 5 episodes compiled from on-ground events) on different facets of financial planning and mutual funds. The on-ground events \\nwill include corporate campus and public auditorium events to engage with first-time investors, homemakers, youth, retail investors, \\nentrepreneur community and retirees. The initiative is also promoted extensively via social media and promos on TV18 channels.\\n6. Media Campaigns – We had a couple of opportunities in the past year to use tactical media campaigns to promote mutual funds \\namongst the masses with the theme/message viral at that point of time.\\na) Cricket World Cup is an important property from an advertising standpoint, as it is once in 4 years, where a lot of ‘eyeballs’ are \\navailable across media. It was an opportune time for us to use this highly viewed event as a tactical opportunity to promote \\nmutual funds amongst the masses and correlate the similarities in Cricket with Mutual Funds. Our investor education campaign, \\n‘Khelo Financial Growth Ka Innings’ , during the World Cup brought out the similarities in scenarios between mutual funds \\nand cricket with advertisements like e.g. Singles can also help win a match (similar to using SIPs to build a corpus) and Long-\\nInnings and Long-term investing both don’t deserve a run out. This was promoted in online media (our website, third-party \\nadvertising and social media) and in select business/personal finance publications like MINT, Business Standard, Financial \\nExpress, Hindu Business Line and ET Wealth.',\n",
              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED11\\nb) Our next tactical campaign of the year was inspired from the Prime Minister’s Independence Day speech where he laid out \\na vision for India to become a $5 Trillion economy. Our message focused on the fact the policy reforms being put in place \\nby the Government for different sectors will enable them to grow. Thus, an allocation through equity funds can enable an \\ninvestor to build long-term wealth and our message ‘Participate in the journey towards a $5 Trillion economy with Equity \\nFunds’  was to reinforce that equity as an asset class through mutual funds is a convenient option to participate. The campaign \\nwas extensively promoted across outdoor (40 cities), online media (our website, third-party advertising and social media) and \\nprint media (English and 8 Regional language publications - Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Tamil, Kannada, Telegu and \\nPunjabi).\\nc) Equity Linked Saving Schemes (ELSS) continue to be an ideal investment option for those looking to build long-term wealth \\nwhile availing tax benefit on their investments. ‘ELSS means LESS tax’ was our message to investors so the tax-saving message \\nclearly stood out to investors. The message explained in detail in the magazine advertisements how investments in ELSS can \\nhelp save tax while elaborating on the benefits on investing in equity-linked schemes like ELSS to build wealth while getting \\ntax benefit on investments of up to `. 1.5 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The message was promoted through \\nbelow-the-line collaterals like banners, standees as well as in online/social media to increase the reach of the message.\\nd) The last quarter of FY 19-20 saw a lot of market movement, firstly with the downturn in the economy and later with the \\ncoronavirus situation limiting activity worldwide, with fall across large, mid and small cap companies. At such a time, we \\nthought to remind investors that such ‘black swan events’ are opportune times to stay invested as long-term goals should not \\nget affected by these bumps in the road. Our message ‘Don’t take a U-turn on your investments’ was to drive that point across \\nand we exclusively used online media (emailers and social media posts) to promote the same as other media were affected \\ndue to the lockdown in force across the country, while the entire audience was online tracking news and other information.\\n7. The AMC conducted 297 Investor Education meets with 17,487 participants in FY 19-20. In these events, trained professionals \\ndiscussed the importance of savings, financial goals, benefit of compounding in wealth creation, healthy wealthy habits amongst \\nother personal finance topics. Investment awareness videos were screened at these programs with trainers available to explain, \\nclarify or answer various queries. Booklets/Collaterals in regional languages on investor awareness were also distributed in these \\nprograms. We also did an investor awareness program at a Chartered Accountants Conference for nearly 3,200 participants. Our \\ninvestor awareness programs are conducted at State Bank of India Branches, Army Cantonments, CRPF, Air Force stations, Educational \\nInstitutes, Municipal Schools and at Corporate offices of Companies. These events continue to be well received by the investing/\\ngeneral public and are key to spreading financial literacy and awareness across the country.\\nNEW INITIATIVES  \\n1. In FY 2020, SBIFM was certified as a ‘Great Place To Work’ for the period March 2020 to Feb 2021. This is a result of High-Trust and \\nHigh-Performance Culture in the organisation. \\n2. On the digital front, 85% of all lumpsum purchase transactions and 75% of all SIP transactions were registered digitally. Despite \\ndiscontinuation of Aadhaar based on-boarding, last year over 10.85 lacs, i.e. 61% of new investors of SBI Mutual Fund were added \\ndigitally. We also launched voice assistants on Alexa and Google Home devices. We have also created ‘smart statement’ of accounts \\nwhich redefines online statement of accounts by including several insights on one’s investments.\\xa0 Further, we introduced the \\nWhatsApp Chatbot in March 2020, which already has over 14,000 registered users.\\n3. Our focus continued to be on the B30 locations as our endeavour is to grow organically through higher penetration in these \\ngeographies. To further boost our efforts in B30 locations, we have launched 14 new Branches in the year taking the total number \\nof Branches to 222 including 176 in B30 locations.\\n4. We have also gained a fair share of the industry SIP book as SIP is one of the strongest investment tools available to investors and it \\nalso adds to regular and sustainable long term inflows in core assets. In March 2020, our SIP book stood at  `1,180 crores as compared \\nto  ` 1,056 crores as of March 2019. \\n5. With a view to build a sustainable business for all the stakeholders and putting investors safety first, we continuously work towards  \\nenhancing our risk mitigation processes and the same has proven to be effective in FY 2020. \\n6. In FY 2020, SBIFM became the first AMC in the country to be fully compliant with the Global Investment Performance Standards( \\nGIPS), administered by the CFA Institute. GIPS is a global guide for the principles that investment companies need to follow while \\ncalculating and presenting performance data to clients. This adds another layer of credibility to our business functioning through \\na fair representation of the performance to our customers ',\n",
              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED12\\n7. With the focus on customer service, SBIFM continues to invest significantly in this segment to help investors throughout their \\ninvestment journey. We have addressed many customer pain points by gathering customer feedback, process improvements, system \\nenhancements, strengthened governance around repeated queries and upskilling of teams along with speedy resolution. We have \\nmade continuous improvement in On-boarding and Investment processes by providing enhanced digital solutions both for our \\ninvestors and distributors. Overall complaints continue to trend downwards. \\n8. We have substantially grown our PMS institutional book by On-boarding some of the most esteemed and the largest PF (Provident \\nFund) organisations. \\n9. From customer’s perspective, SBI Mutual Fund continues to believe in offering investment solutions rather than a product-selling \\napproach.\\xa0 Accordingly, we launched services such as SWP – A, SIP Top up cap, SIP Pause etc. during the year. \\nVII. CHANGE IN NATURE OF BUSINESS \\nThere was no change in the nature of business during the year under review.\\nVIII. MATERIAL CHANGES AND COMMITMENTS, IF ANY AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE COMPANY \\nWHICH HAVE OCCURED IN BETWEEN THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR OF THE COMPANY TO WHICH THE FINANCIAL \\nSTATEMENTS RELATE AND THE DATE OF THE REPORT\\nThere have been no material changes and commitments affecting the financial position of the Company which have occurred between \\nthe end of the financial year 2019-20 and the date of this report.\\nIX.

While everyone is trying innovative ways to ensure business continuity, the real challenge will be the new world \\nthat we will be a part of once this is over and we enter a new normal. \\n2. From the business perspective, we expect FY 20-21 to be a challenging year for the entire industry, both from the perspective of \\ngrowth in assets as well as pressure on margins. We will accordingly focus on cost optimization through forward and backward \\nintegration. However, we will continue to invest in the core needs of business enhancement. We will also make significant investments \\ninto technology to protect our data and develop highest standards of data security.\\n3. On the digital front, we will continue to work on making the customer journey more personalised and effective in better investment \\nplanning. We will work on a data platform project which will help in various analytics use-cases for business impact.\\xa0\\n4. In terms of our product basket, we will continue to add funds, both from the point of view of introducing innovative products and \\naddressing product gaps. We will have products across solution-oriented and debt categories. We will also continue to expand our \\npassive offerings. We will also focus on creating tools and solutions which will help investors in achieving their investment goals.\\n5. We will continue to develop newer business segments of PMS and AIF by launching differentiated strategies under these vehicles.\\nX.

              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED44\\n1.6.2  Other Income:\\n(a) Dividend income:\\n Dividend income from investments is recognised when the right to receive payment has been established, which \\nis generally when shareholders approve the dividend. On investments in certain mutual funds, the company is \\nentitled to a daily / weekly dividend. This dividend is accounted for at such frequency as the right to receive \\npayment is established.\\n(b)  Interest income:\\n Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to \\nthe Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by \\nreference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate (EIR) applicable, which is the rate that \\nexactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net \\ncarrying amount on initial recognition. Interest income is included in finance income in the statement of profit \\nand loss. In case of staff loans interest income is recognised on accrual basis.\\n1.7  Scheme Expenses \\n(a)  Recurring expenses of schemes borne by the Company are recognised under respective expense heads in the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss unless considered recoverable from the schemes in accordance with provisions of SEBI (Mutual Fund) \\nRegulations 1996 and circular issued from time to time.\\n Expenses of schemes of SBI Mutual Fund, in excess of the stipulated rates, are required to be borne by the Company in \\naccordance with the requirements of SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, and as such, are charged to the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss.\\n(b)  Brokerage: Brokerage and/or Incentive paid on investments in open-ended Equity Linked Tax Saving Schemes and \\nSystematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are amortized over a period of 36 months and in case of other schemes, over the claw \\nback period from beginning of the month brokerage is paid.

A contract is, or contains, a lease if \\nthe contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. \\nTo assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) \\nthe contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use \\nof the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. At the date of \\ncommencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all \\nlease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low \\nvalue leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense \\non a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \\n Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU \\nassets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. The right-of-use \\nassets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments \\nmade at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are \\nsubsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from \\nthe commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.

              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED45\\nRight of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying \\namounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair \\nvalue less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash \\nflows that are largely independent of those from other assets. \\n The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments \\nare discounted using the interest rate. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of \\nuse asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. Lease liability \\nand ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash \\nflows. \\n1.9 Foreign currencies\\n(a)  Functional and presentation currency\\n Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of primary economic environment in which \\nthe company operates (‘the Functional currency’).

Monetary items:\\n Foreign exchange gains or losses realized up on settlement of transactions or translation of monetary assets \\nand liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in profit and loss account using reporting date \\nexchange rates.\\nii. Non-monetary items : \\n Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the \\nexchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. \\n Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into functional currency \\nat the exchange rate when fair value is determined. \\n The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the \\nrecognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose \\nfair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).\\n1.10  Employee benefits  \\n(a)  Defined Contribution Plan :\\n- Provident Fund  \\n The Company has defined contribution plans for post-employment benefits in the form of Provident fund. Under \\nthe Provident Fund plan, the company contributes to Government administered Provident Fund on behalf of \\nemployees.

The Company accounts for liability for future gratuity \\nbenefits based on the actuarial valuation using Projected Unit Credit Method carried out as at the end of each \\nfinancial year. Actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognized in the Statement of Profit and loss. \\n Gratuity liabilities are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an independent actuary, at each reporting \\ndate using the projected unit credit method. The Company recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit \\nplan in its balance sheet as an asset or liability, as the case may be. The discount rate is based on the government \\nsecurities yield. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions \\nare recorded in other comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which \\nthey arise.\\n(c)  Other Long-term employee benefit obligation : Compensated absences\\n The company provides for the encashment of leave or leave with pay subject to certain rules.

The liability is provided based on the \\nnumber of days of unutilized leave at each balance sheet date on the basis of an independent actuarial valuation \\ncarried out as at the end of each financial year. \\n(d)  Employee Share Based Payments:\\n Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair \\nvalue of the equity instruments at the grant date.\\n The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on amortised \\nbasis over the vesting period, based on the Company's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, \\nwith a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of \\nthe number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is \\nrecognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding \\nadjustment to the equity-settled employee benefits reserve.\\n1.11  Income taxes\\n Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year. \\nCurrent and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised \\nin other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other \\ncomprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\\n(a) Current tax\\n Current income tax for current and prior period is recognised at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid \\nto the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted at the \\nreporting date.\\n Current income taxes are recognised in the statement of profit and loss except for items those are recognised outside \\nprofit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity), related tax for such items are recognised either in \\nOther Comprehensive income or in Equity.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE\",\n",

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are \\nmeasured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, \\nbased on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. \\n The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent \\nthat it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset \\nto be recovered. \\n Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences except for investment in subsidiaries \\nand associates, when the timings of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that \\nthe temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. \\n1.12  Property, plant and equipment\\n(a)  Recognition and measurement\\n All items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment \\nlosses, if any. Historical cost includes expenses directly attributable to the acquisition of an asset.\\n Advances paid towards the acquisition of property and equipment and the cost of property and equipment not ready \\nfor use before the reporting date are disclosed separately in the property and equipment schedule.\\n Improvements to leasehold premises are amortised over the primary lease period subject to a maximum period of five \\nyears.\\n(b) Depreciation\\n Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognised using Straight Line Method (SLM) to expense the cost less \\nresidual values over estimated useful lives as prescribed under Schedule II of Companies Act, 2013.

Amortisation expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated \\nuseful lives in the statement of profit and loss. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at \\nthe end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective \\nbasis. \\n(b)  Useful lives of intangible assets\\n Estimated useful lives of the intangible assets adopted by management are as follows:\\nDescription of assets Useful lives \\n (In years)Method of depreciation / \\namortization \\nComputer software 3 - 6 years SLM\\nWebsite development cost 3 years SLM\\nCopyright licenses 5 years SLM\\n1.14  De-recognition of PPE and Intangible Assets\\n Carrying amount (net of accumulated depreciation and amortisation) of property, plant and equipment and intangible \\nasset is derecognised upon its disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued \\nuse of the asset.\\n Any gains or losses arising on such disposal is determined based on difference between net proceeds and carrying \\namount and such gains or losses are recognised in statement of profit and loss. \\n1.15  Provisions, Contingent liability and contingent asset \\n Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past events, \\nit is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and \\na reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\\n The expenses relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement.\\n Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the \\npresent obligation at the end of reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is pre-tax rate \\nthat reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specified to the liability. The increase \\nin provision due to passage of time is recognised as finance cost. \\n When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third \\nparty, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount \\nof the receivable can be measured reliably.\\n Contingent liabilities\\n A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the \\noccurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present \\nobligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the \\nobligation.

              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED50\\n For trade receivables Company applies ‘simplified approach’ which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised \\nfrom initial recognition of the receivables. The Company uses historical default rates to determine impairment loss on \\nthe portfolio of trade receivables. At every reporting date, these historical default rates are reviewed and changes in \\nthe forward-looking estimates are analysed. \\n For other assets, the Company uses 12-month ECL to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase \\nin credit risk. If there is significant increase in credit risk full lifetime ECL is used.\\n Financial liabilities\\n Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost. For trade and other payables maturing within one year \\nfrom the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\\n Derecognition of financial liabilities\\n The Company derecognises financial liabilities when the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have \\nexpired. \\n Equity instruments :\\n All equity investments in scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading \\nare classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company decides to classify the same either as at FVTOCI \\nor FVTPL. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by instrument basis. The classification is made on initial \\nrecognition and is irrevocable. If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value \\nchanges on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from \\nOCI to Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative \\ngain or loss within equity.\\n Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss.\\n1.17  Earnings per share\\n The basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity \\nshares outstanding during the year.\\n Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue equity \\nshares were exercised or converted during the period/year. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted \\naverage number of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding at the year end.\\n1.18  Dividends\\n Final dividends on shares are recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the shareholders and interim dividends \\nare recorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the company’s Board of Directors.\\n1.19  Standards Issued but not Effective\\n There is no such notification issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) which would have been applicable \\nfrom April 1, 2020.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE',\n",

The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition \\nof the Investment strategy .   \\nRisks associated with defined benefit plan    \\nGratuity is a defined benefit plan and company is exposed to the Following Risks:    \\nInterest rate risk:  A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the G.Sec Rate will Increase the present value of the liability requiring \\nhigher provision. A fall in the discount rate generally increase the mark to market value of the assets depending on the duration of \\nasset.    \\nSalary Risk:  The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of members As such an \\nincrease in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.    \\nInvestment Risk:  The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by \\nreference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will \\ncreate a plan deficit. Currently, for the plan in India it has a relatively balanced mix of investments in government securities, and other \\ndebt instruments.    \\nAsset Liability Matching Risk:  The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow Since the plan is invested in lines of Rule 101 of \\nIncome Tax Rules, 1962. this generally reduces ALM risk.    \\nMortality risk:  Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan do not have any \\nlongevity risk    \\nConcentration Risk:  Plan is having a concentration risk all the assets are invested in the insurance company and a default will wipe out \\nall the assets. Although probability of this is very less as Insurance companies have to follow regulatory guidelines.   \\nGratuity is taken care by separate trust fund and contribution is guided by Rule 103 of Income Tax Rules 1962.   \\nThe principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows.\\nParticulars Valuation as at\\n31 Mar 2020 31 Mar 2019\\nDiscount rate(s) 6.89% 7.79%\\nExpected rate(s) of salary increase 5% p.a 5% p.aNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE\",\n",

Liquidity Risk \\nLiquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The company maintains sufficient \\nbank balance and marketable securities such as liquid/ultra-short duration and other debt funds.\\n2. Credit Risk \\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing financial \\nloss to the company. The company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business \\nactivities. The company has well defined investment policy restricting investments in various risk categories such high/moderate high/\\nmoderate etc.\\n3. Foreign currency risk management:    \\nThe company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. \\nExchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.\\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the \\nreporting period are as follows.     \\n(` in Lakhs)\\nCurrency Liabilities Assets\\nAs at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019As at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019\\nAED - 7.73 13.23\\nUSD 18.81 44.44 866.81 622.97\\nBHD 22.95 10.28                    -                     -   \\nAUD -                       -   3.52 2.67\\nJPY                   -                         -   76.98 82.73\\nSGD                   -                         -   127.29 151.66\\n \\nForeign currency sensitivity analysis:    \\nThe following table details the Company’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the Rupee against the relevant foreign \\ncurrencies. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents \\nmanagement’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding \\nforeign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency \\nrates.

On investments in certain mutual funds, the company is \\nentitled to a daily / weekly dividend. This dividend is accounted for at such frequency as the right to receive \\npayment is established.\\n(b)  Interest income:\\n Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to \\nthe Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by \\nreference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate (EIR) applicable, which is the rate that \\nexactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net \\ncarrying amount on initial recognition.

They are \\nsubsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from \\nthe commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. \\nRight of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying \\namounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair \\nvalue less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash \\nflows that are largely independent of those from other assets. \\n The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments \\nare discounted using the interest rate. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of \\nuse asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.

The discount rate used to determine the present value is pre-tax rate that reflects \\ncurrent market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specified to the liability. The increase in provision due to \\npassage of time is recognised as finance cost. \\n When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a \\nreceivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable \\ncan be measured reliably.\\n Contingent liabilities\\n A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence \\nor non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present obligation that is \\nnot recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation.

All financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables \\nwhich are initially measured at transaction price. \\n Subsequent measurement\\n Financial assets carried at amortised cost\\n A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold \\nthe asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates \\nto cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\\n Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\\n A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is held within a business \\nmodel whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual \\nterms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the \\nprincipal amount outstanding.\\n The Company has made an irrevocable election for its investments which are classified as equity instruments to present the \\nsubsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income based on its business model.

The Company uses historical default rates to determine impairment loss on the portfolio \\nof trade receivables. At every reporting date, these historical default rates are reviewed and changes in the forward-looking \\nestimates are analysed. \\n For other assets, the Company uses 12-month ECL to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase in \\ncredit risk. If there is significant increase in credit risk full lifetime ECL is used.\\n Financial liabilities\\n Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost. For trade and other payables maturing within one year from \\nthe Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\\n Derecognition of financial liabilities\\n The Company derecognises financial liabilities when the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired. \\n Equity instruments :\\n All equity investments in scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading are \\nclassified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company decides to classify the same either as at FVTOCI or FVTPL. \\nThe Company makes such election on an instrument-by instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition \\nand is irrevocable. If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the \\ninstrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to Statement of \\nProfit and Loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.\\n Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss.\\n1.16  Earnings per share\\n The basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares \\noutstanding during the year.\\n Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue equity shares \\nwere exercised or converted during the period/year. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average \\nnumber of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding at the year end.\\n1.17  Dividends\\n Final dividends on shares are recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the shareholders and interim dividends are \\nrecorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the company’s Board of Directors.\\n1.18  Standards Issued but not Effective\\n There is no such notification issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) which would have been applicable from \\nApril 1, 2020NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS',\n",

The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition \\nof the Investment strategy .\\nRisks associated with defined benefit plan    \\nGratuity is a defined benefit plan and company is exposed to the Following Risks:    \\nInterest rate risk: A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the G.Sec Rate will Increase the present value of the liability requiring \\nhigher provision. A fall in the discount rate generally increase the mark to market value of the assets depending on the duration of \\nasset.    \\nSalary Risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of members As such an \\nincrease in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.    \\nInvestment Risk:  The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by \\nreference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will \\ncreate a plan deficit Currently, for the plan in India it has a relatively balanced mix of investments in government securities, and other \\ndebt instruments.    \\nAsset Liability Matching Risk:  The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow Since the plan is invested in lines of Rule 101 of \\nIncome Tax Rules, 1962. this generally reduces ALM risk.    \\nMortality risk: Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan do not have any \\nlongevity risk    \\nConcentration Risk: Plan is having a concentration risk all the assets are invested in the insurance company and a default will wipe out \\nall the assets.

The Company has been regular in servicing its \\ndues thus far and the short term investment thesis continues to remain intact. In view of the same, we believe that there is no impairment \\nin the investment and it can be valued at its cost as at reporting date.

Liquidity Risk\\nLiquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The company maintains sufficient \\nbank balance and marketable securities such as liquid/ultra-short duration and other debt funds.”  \\n2. Credit Risk \\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing financial \\nloss to the company. The company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business \\nactivities. The company has well defined investment policy restricting investments in various risk categories such high/moderate high/\\nmoderate etc.       \\n3. Foreign currency risk management:    \\nThe company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. \\nExchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.\\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the \\nreporting period are as follows.                                                                                                                        \\n(` in Lakhs)\\nCurrency Liabilities Assets\\nAs at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019As at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019\\nAED - - 7.73 13.23\\nUSD 18.81 44.44 866.81 622.97\\nBHD 22.95 10.28  -    -   \\nAUD  -    -   3.52 2.67\\nJPY  -    -   76.98 82.73\\nSGD  -    -   127.29 151.66\\n ',\n",

The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding \\nforeign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency \\nrates. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or equity where the Rupee strengthens 10% against the relevant currency. \\nFor a 10% weakening of the Rupee against the relevant currency, there would be a comparable impact on the profit or equity, and the \\nbalances below would be negative.  \\n(` in Lakhs)\\nCurrency Impact on profit or loss for the year Impact on total equity as at the end of \\nthe reporting period\\nAs at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019As at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019\\nAED Currency impact  0.58  0.91  0.58  0.91 \\nUSD Currency impact  65.39  39.83  65.39  39.83 \\nBHD Currency impact  1.72  0.67  1.72  0.67 \\nAUD Currency impact  0.26  0.02  0.26  0.02 \\nJPY Currency impact  5.76  2.29  5.76  2.29 \\nSGD Currency impact  9.53  5.47  9.53  5.47 \\nIn management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk because the exposure at the \\nend of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during the year and  considering the size of business and  size of  exposure \\nin Foreign currency is immaterial.    \\n36.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT:\\nFinancial year 2019-20 has seen it all, from the markets reaching its all-time high to three-year returns being erased within a span of a \\nmonth. This year we saw the GDP touching its lowest level in seven years while crude oil fell to levels last seen about 18 years back. The \\nbiggest shock came at the end of the year, the COVID-19 global pandemic on a scale that’s seen once in a lifetime.\\nOverall, the NIFTY delivered negative returns of around 26% for FY19-20. Midcaps and Smallcaps that had started outperforming largecaps \\nby early 2020, gave away all the outperformance and underperformed the largecap indices. When compared to other emerging markets, \\nIndia was a stark underperformer with MSCI India delivering negative returns of nearly 32% (in US$ terms) compared with MSCI Emerging \\nMarket Index’s -20%.',\n",
              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED6\\nThe fiscal year had started on a positive note helped by a strong political mandate at the center and India being a natural hedge against \\nthe adverse growth impact of US-China trade war. The full majority to BJP led NDA government reinforced the belief in some of the \\npolicies undertaken during their last term; particularly the actions to keep the inflation contained and focus on social security net.  \\nHowever, the slowing economic growth (4.7% in Q3 FY20), the slowest in almost 7 years, and stress in the non-banking financial entities \\nkept the markets jittery. The sharp economic slowdown necessitated policy action at a war scale. The Government responded with big \\nbang reforms on corporate taxes, which boosted market sentiment.  Further, India being integrated with the rest of the world was also \\nimpacted a bit by slowing global growth. \\nDespite a backdrop of weak economic growth, the Indian markets hit fresh highs in early 2020 on expectations of economic recovery. Both \\nservice sector and manufacturing sector PMIs had started looking up. Even the IIP numbers suggested that the economy was turning in \\nthe Jan-Feb 2020 period. However, the recovery was cut short by the sudden outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic.\\nMarkets plummeted consequently in line with the global markets, reacting as much to the lockdown and its economic fallout as to the \\npandemic itself. FPIs (Foreign Portfolio Investors) that had positive inflows for most part of the financial year, sold nearly US$ 8.3bn worth \\nof equities in March alone even as DIIs bought US$ 7.5bn. For the full financial year, FPIs were net buyers to the tune of US$ 1.3 billion \\nin equities. \\nThere will be economic consequences as the world deals with triple shocks simultaneously- supply shock, demand shock, and oil shock \\n(as oil prices plunged after the disagreement between OPEC nations on cutting down of oil supply). Aggressive policy intervention will \\nbe critical in limiting the damage.\\nThe government announced a ` 1.7 trillion stimulus aimed at easing the bottom of the pyramid through the lockdown. At 0.8% of GDP \\nthis would be modest compared to several other countries that have undertaken much larger stimuli; the US for example has approved a \\npackage which is 10% of their GDP. We hope that on the other side of the lockdown, there will be more help from the government. The \\npain that several businesses, especially smaller ones, face around their very survival and the corresponding rise in unemployment, need \\nto be addressed. While poverty in India has usually been associated with rural India, this crisis has brought to fore the plight of the urban \\npoor, who will need focused support as unemployment situation continues to worsen.\\nOn the fixed income markets side, the market rallied in the initial months of the financial year with the budget adhering to fiscal \\nconsolidation, global developments tilting towards monetary easing, accommodative RBI policy on the backdrop of slowing economic \\ngrowth and surplus systemic liquidity. \\nThe bond market remained volatile for the remaining part of the year on concerns about the prospects of fiscal slippage due to tax cut \\nannouncement and on the prospects of additional fiscal stimulus measures given the economic slowdown. With hike in the near-term CPI, \\nRBI kept the policy action on hold post the October 2019 policy and resorted to unconventional actions to ensure that term premiums \\nreduce. These measures were intended to bring down sovereign rates and thereby enable better transmission in the corporate markets \\nover time. \\nLiquidity conditions remained in surplus all through the second half of the financial year, with the effective overnight rates trading \\nsubstantially below the policy rate in all the secured overnight funding markets. The onset of market volatility post the large scale spread \\nof the Covid-19 pandemic across the globe rattled domestic debt markets as large scale FPI outflows were witnessed. \\nThe RBI advanced its scheduled April review and announced an out of schedule policy Repo rate cut by 75bps to 4.40%. Simultaneously \\nCRR was cut by 100 bps along with a Targeted LTRO(Long Term Repo Operations) of ` 1 trillion specifically for purchase of corporate bonds \\nin primary and secondary markets. These extraordinary measures announced at the end of March 2020 had the impact of unwinding the \\nstressed levels witnessed during the preceding few weeks with rates across the curve retracing substantially. While fiscal pressures would \\nmagnify in the current context with the shutdown, RBI direct and indirect accommodation of the same becomes an inevitable option at \\nsome point.\\nThe year was:\\nMarked by regular inflows of assets, the Indian Mutual Fund Industry witnessed a reasonable growth of approximately 10%* in terms \\nof Quarterly AAUM (Average Assets Under Management). The Quarterly AAUM for the industry reached ` 27,02,511 Crores* (March 31, \\n2020) from ` 24,48,121 Crores* (March 31, 2019).

Development and Dissemination of Investor Education material \\na. Articles – This year we partnered with the India Today Group for a series of investor education articles on different areas of \\npersonal finance, investing and mutual funds. A separate section has been created in the English & Hindi editions of their \\nIndia Today magazine called ‘Nivesh Yatra – The Journey towards Financial Freedom’ for this initiative which publishes articles \\nfor their readers. In addition, we developed brochures from in-house content like ‘Planning for Retirement’ and ’14 Reasons \\nto fall in love with Mutual Funds’ to promote the effectiveness of mutual funds as an investment solution. The content when \\nrequired, is adapted to formats like online mailers/WhatsApp and is circulated to investors and distribution partners alike and \\nhosted on our website blog - Inspire.  ',\n",
              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED10\\nb. Videos – We worked with content partners to develop videos on hybrid funds and benefits of staying invested. The video \\ntitled ‘Bumpy Ride’ highlights the benefits of staying invested despite ups and downs in market conditions while the second \\nvideo titled “H itesh Ritesh” shows the investment journey of two friends where one chooses to stay invested during volatile \\nmarkets and reaches his financial goals, while the other friend chooses to opt out during tough market conditions. Their \\njourney is beautifully showcased lyrically. We also developed a light-hearted video on Children’s Day with two child artists who \\nare curious to know about things in their surroundings. The message that we wanted to convey was as an investor you must \\nhave many queries about your investments and mutual funds could be an answer for the same. All videos were promoted \\nthrough our social media channels.\\n2. Social Media – Our objective\\xa0on social media\\xa0is to drive more engagement on our\\xa0official social handles by using an approach of \\nunique content, rich formats, and engaging representation.\\xa0Following this approach, we have run quite a few quiz\\xa0series under \\nthe name #SBIMFQuizTime on\\xa0Twitter with an intention to engage with our existing and potential followers\\xa0on different aspects \\nof mutual funds and financial planning.\\xa0We also did some topical content on festivals and occasion such as:\\n a.

Public Relations/Media – With the evolving media consumption habits, interaction across social media, print publications, and \\nonline media remains important. We continue to reach out to key media including regional (Newspapers, Magazines, Online and \\nTelevision) to establish thought leadership by getting relevant coverage in large format industry stories, authored articles and Q&A’s \\nwith spokespersons covering business, funds and investment and investor awareness aspects. We also continued to have a sustained \\nfocus on reaching out to potential investors through regional media sharing concepts for investor awareness like our ‘Nivesh Ke \\nNuske’ section in magazines like ‘Nivesh Manthan’\\xa0and highlighting the benefits of mutual funds, financial planning and other \\naspects of personal finance.\\xa0 \\xa0\\n5. Television & On-ground Events – Our association with CNBC Awaaz, a leading Hindi business channel from the CNBC-TV18 network, \\nfor Pehla Kadam – Season 5, a holistic investor education initiative across India, continued this year with an exclusive tie-up to \\npromote mutual funds as an investment option for financial goals. This included a mix of on-ground events, in-studio discussions, \\ncorporate campus events and online/social media. As part of the sponsorship, we plan to have 15 episodes (10 in-studio discussions \\nand 5 episodes compiled from on-ground events) on different facets of financial planning and mutual funds. The on-ground events \\nwill include corporate campus and public auditorium events to engage with first-time investors, homemakers, youth, retail investors, \\nentrepreneur community and retirees. The initiative is also promoted extensively via social media and promos on TV18 channels.\\n6. Media Campaigns – We had a couple of opportunities in the past year to use tactical media campaigns to promote mutual funds \\namongst the masses with the theme/message viral at that point of time.\\na) Cricket World Cup is an important property from an advertising standpoint, as it is once in 4 years, where a lot of ‘eyeballs’ are \\navailable across media. It was an opportune time for us to use this highly viewed event as a tactical opportunity to promote \\nmutual funds amongst the masses and correlate the similarities in Cricket with Mutual Funds. Our investor education campaign, \\n‘Khelo Financial Growth Ka Innings’ , during the World Cup brought out the similarities in scenarios between mutual funds \\nand cricket with advertisements like e.g. Singles can also help win a match (similar to using SIPs to build a corpus) and Long-\\nInnings and Long-term investing both don’t deserve a run out. This was promoted in online media (our website, third-party \\nadvertising and social media) and in select business/personal finance publications like MINT, Business Standard, Financial \\nExpress, Hindu Business Line and ET Wealth.',\n",
              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED11\\nb) Our next tactical campaign of the year was inspired from the Prime Minister’s Independence Day speech where he laid out \\na vision for India to become a $5 Trillion economy. Our message focused on the fact the policy reforms being put in place \\nby the Government for different sectors will enable them to grow. Thus, an allocation through equity funds can enable an \\ninvestor to build long-term wealth and our message ‘Participate in the journey towards a $5 Trillion economy with Equity \\nFunds’  was to reinforce that equity as an asset class through mutual funds is a convenient option to participate. The campaign \\nwas extensively promoted across outdoor (40 cities), online media (our website, third-party advertising and social media) and \\nprint media (English and 8 Regional language publications - Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Tamil, Kannada, Telegu and \\nPunjabi).\\nc) Equity Linked Saving Schemes (ELSS) continue to be an ideal investment option for those looking to build long-term wealth \\nwhile availing tax benefit on their investments. ‘ELSS means LESS tax’ was our message to investors so the tax-saving message \\nclearly stood out to investors. The message explained in detail in the magazine advertisements how investments in ELSS can \\nhelp save tax while elaborating on the benefits on investing in equity-linked schemes like ELSS to build wealth while getting \\ntax benefit on investments of up to `. 1.5 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The message was promoted through \\nbelow-the-line collaterals like banners, standees as well as in online/social media to increase the reach of the message.\\nd) The last quarter of FY 19-20 saw a lot of market movement, firstly with the downturn in the economy and later with the \\ncoronavirus situation limiting activity worldwide, with fall across large, mid and small cap companies. At such a time, we \\nthought to remind investors that such ‘black swan events’ are opportune times to stay invested as long-term goals should not \\nget affected by these bumps in the road. Our message ‘Don’t take a U-turn on your investments’ was to drive that point across \\nand we exclusively used online media (emailers and social media posts) to promote the same as other media were affected \\ndue to the lockdown in force across the country, while the entire audience was online tracking news and other information.\\n7. The AMC conducted 297 Investor Education meets with 17,487 participants in FY 19-20. In these events, trained professionals \\ndiscussed the importance of savings, financial goals, benefit of compounding in wealth creation, healthy wealthy habits amongst \\nother personal finance topics. Investment awareness videos were screened at these programs with trainers available to explain, \\nclarify or answer various queries. Booklets/Collaterals in regional languages on investor awareness were also distributed in these \\nprograms. We also did an investor awareness program at a Chartered Accountants Conference for nearly 3,200 participants. Our \\ninvestor awareness programs are conducted at State Bank of India Branches, Army Cantonments, CRPF, Air Force stations, Educational \\nInstitutes, Municipal Schools and at Corporate offices of Companies. These events continue to be well received by the investing/\\ngeneral public and are key to spreading financial literacy and awareness across the country.\\nNEW INITIATIVES  \\n1. In FY 2020, SBIFM was certified as a ‘Great Place To Work’ for the period March 2020 to Feb 2021. This is a result of High-Trust and \\nHigh-Performance Culture in the organisation. \\n2.

Despite \\ndiscontinuation of Aadhaar based on-boarding, last year over 10.85 lacs, i.e. 61% of new investors of SBI Mutual Fund were added \\ndigitally. We also launched voice assistants on Alexa and Google Home devices. We have also created ‘smart statement’ of accounts \\nwhich redefines online statement of accounts by including several insights on one’s investments.\\xa0 Further, we introduced the \\nWhatsApp Chatbot in March 2020, which already has over 14,000 registered users.\\n3.

To further boost our efforts in B30 locations, we have launched 14 new Branches in the year taking the total number \\nof Branches to 222 including 176 in B30 locations.\\n4. We have also gained a fair share of the industry SIP book as SIP is one of the strongest investment tools available to investors and it \\nalso adds to regular and sustainable long term inflows in core assets. In March 2020, our SIP book stood at  `1,180 crores as compared \\nto  ` 1,056 crores as of March 2019. \\n5. With a view to build a sustainable business for all the stakeholders and putting investors safety first, we continuously work towards  \\nenhancing our risk mitigation processes and the same has proven to be effective in FY 2020. \\n6. In FY 2020, SBIFM became the first AMC in the country to be fully compliant with the Global Investment Performance Standards( \\nGIPS), administered by the CFA Institute. GIPS is a global guide for the principles that investment companies need to follow while \\ncalculating and presenting performance data to clients.

On investments in certain mutual funds, the company is \\nentitled to a daily / weekly dividend. This dividend is accounted for at such frequency as the right to receive \\npayment is established.\\n(b)  Interest income:\\n Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to \\nthe Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by \\nreference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate (EIR) applicable, which is the rate that \\nexactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net \\ncarrying amount on initial recognition. Interest income is included in finance income in the statement of profit \\nand loss. In case of staff loans interest income is recognised on accrual basis.\\n1.7  Scheme Expenses \\n(a)  Recurring expenses of schemes borne by the Company are recognised under respective expense heads in the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss unless considered recoverable from the schemes in accordance with provisions of SEBI (Mutual Fund) \\nRegulations 1996 and circular issued from time to time.\\n Expenses of schemes of SBI Mutual Fund, in excess of the stipulated rates, are required to be borne by the Company in \\naccordance with the requirements of SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, and as such, are charged to the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss.\\n(b)  Brokerage: Brokerage and/or Incentive paid on investments in open-ended Equity Linked Tax Saving Schemes and \\nSystematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are amortized over a period of 36 months and in case of other schemes, over the claw \\nback period from beginning of the month brokerage is paid.

A contract is, or contains, a lease if \\nthe contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. \\nTo assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) \\nthe contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use \\nof the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. At the date of \\ncommencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all \\nlease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low \\nvalue leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense \\non a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \\n Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU \\nassets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. The right-of-use \\nassets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments \\nmade at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are \\nsubsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from \\nthe commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.

              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED45\\nRight of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying \\namounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair \\nvalue less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash \\nflows that are largely independent of those from other assets. \\n The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments \\nare discounted using the interest rate. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of \\nuse asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. Lease liability \\nand ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash \\nflows. \\n1.9 Foreign currencies\\n(a)  Functional and presentation currency\\n Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of primary economic environment in which \\nthe company operates (‘the Functional currency’).

Monetary items:\\n Foreign exchange gains or losses realized up on settlement of transactions or translation of monetary assets \\nand liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in profit and loss account using reporting date \\nexchange rates.\\nii. Non-monetary items : \\n Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the \\nexchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. \\n Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into functional currency \\nat the exchange rate when fair value is determined. \\n The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the \\nrecognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose \\nfair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).\\n1.10  Employee benefits  \\n(a)  Defined Contribution Plan :\\n- Provident Fund  \\n The Company has defined contribution plans for post-employment benefits in the form of Provident fund. Under \\nthe Provident Fund plan, the company contributes to Government administered Provident Fund on behalf of \\nemployees.

Actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognized in the Statement of Profit and loss. \\n Gratuity liabilities are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an independent actuary, at each reporting \\ndate using the projected unit credit method. The Company recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit \\nplan in its balance sheet as an asset or liability, as the case may be. The discount rate is based on the government \\nsecurities yield. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions \\nare recorded in other comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which \\nthey arise.\\n(c)  Other Long-term employee benefit obligation : Compensated absences\\n The company provides for the encashment of leave or leave with pay subject to certain rules.

At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of \\nthe number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is \\nrecognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding \\nadjustment to the equity-settled employee benefits reserve.\\n1.11  Income taxes\\n Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year. \\nCurrent and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised \\nin other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other \\ncomprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\\n(a) Current tax\\n Current income tax for current and prior period is recognised at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid \\nto the taxation authorities.

The discount rate used to determine the present value is pre-tax rate \\nthat reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specified to the liability. The increase \\nin provision due to passage of time is recognised as finance cost. \\n When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third \\nparty, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount \\nof the receivable can be measured reliably.\\n Contingent liabilities\\n A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the \\noccurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present \\nobligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the \\nobligation.

The Company uses historical default rates to determine impairment loss on \\nthe portfolio of trade receivables. At every reporting date, these historical default rates are reviewed and changes in \\nthe forward-looking estimates are analysed. \\n For other assets, the Company uses 12-month ECL to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase \\nin credit risk. If there is significant increase in credit risk full lifetime ECL is used.\\n Financial liabilities\\n Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost. For trade and other payables maturing within one year \\nfrom the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\\n Derecognition of financial liabilities\\n The Company derecognises financial liabilities when the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have \\nexpired. \\n Equity instruments :\\n All equity investments in scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value.

The Company makes such election on an instrument-by instrument basis. The classification is made on initial \\nrecognition and is irrevocable. If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value \\nchanges on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from \\nOCI to Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of investment.

The fund has the form of a trust and it is \\ngoverned by the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition \\nof the Investment strategy .   \\nRisks associated with defined benefit plan    \\nGratuity is a defined benefit plan and company is exposed to the Following Risks:    \\nInterest rate risk:  A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the G.Sec Rate will Increase the present value of the liability requiring \\nhigher provision. A fall in the discount rate generally increase the mark to market value of the assets depending on the duration of \\nasset.    \\nSalary Risk:  The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of members As such an \\nincrease in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.    \\nInvestment Risk:  The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by \\nreference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will \\ncreate a plan deficit. Currently, for the plan in India it has a relatively balanced mix of investments in government securities, and other \\ndebt instruments.    \\nAsset Liability Matching Risk:  The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow Since the plan is invested in lines of Rule 101 of \\nIncome Tax Rules, 1962. this generally reduces ALM risk.    \\nMortality risk:  Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan do not have any \\nlongevity risk    \\nConcentration Risk:  Plan is having a concentration risk all the assets are invested in the insurance company and a default will wipe out \\nall the assets.

The Company has been regular in servicing its \\ndues thus far and the short term investment thesis continues to remain intact. In view of the same, we believe that there is no impairment \\nin the investment and it can be valued at its cost as at reporting date. (PY-On the basis of the value provided by the AMFI authorised \\nagencies in accordance to the valuation guidelines.) \\nCapital management :       \\nThe Company’s capital management strategy is to effectively determine, raise and deploy capital so as to create value for its shareholders. \\nThe same is done through equity.       \\nFinancial Risk Management Framework :       \\nThe different types of risks the company is exposed to are liquidity risk credit risk and foreign currency risk.   \\n1. Liquidity Risk \\nLiquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The company maintains sufficient \\nbank balance and marketable securities such as liquid/ultra-short duration and other debt funds.\\n2. Credit Risk \\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing financial \\nloss to the company. The company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business \\nactivities. The company has well defined investment policy restricting investments in various risk categories such high/moderate high/\\nmoderate etc.\\n3. Foreign currency risk management:    \\nThe company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. \\nExchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.\\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the \\nreporting period are as follows.     \\n(` in Lakhs)\\nCurrency Liabilities Assets\\nAs at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019As at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019\\nAED - 7.73 13.23\\nUSD 18.81 44.44 866.81 622.97\\nBHD 22.95 10.28                    -                     -   \\nAUD -                       -   3.52 2.67\\nJPY                   -                         -   76.98 82.73\\nSGD                   -                         -   127.29 151.66\\n \\nForeign currency sensitivity analysis:    \\nThe following table details the Company’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the Rupee against the relevant foreign \\ncurrencies. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents \\nmanagement’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding \\nforeign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency \\nrates.

For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair \\nvalue less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash \\nflows that are largely independent of those from other assets. \\n The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments.

The company has well defined investment policy restricting investments in various risk categories such high/moderate high/\\nmoderate etc.       \\n3.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT:\\nFinancial year 2019-20 has seen it all, from the markets reaching its all-time high to three-year returns being erased within a span of a \\nmonth. This year we saw the GDP touching its lowest level in seven years while crude oil fell to levels last seen about 18 years back. The \\nbiggest shock came at the end of the year, the COVID-19 global pandemic on a scale that’s seen once in a lifetime.\\nOverall, the NIFTY delivered negative returns of around 26% for FY19-20. Midcaps and Smallcaps that had started outperforming largecaps \\nby early 2020, gave away all the outperformance and underperformed the largecap indices. When compared to other emerging markets, \\nIndia was a stark underperformer with MSCI India delivering negative returns of nearly 32% (in US$ terms) compared with MSCI Emerging \\nMarket Index’s -20%.',\n",
              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED6\\nThe fiscal year had started on a positive note helped by a strong political mandate at the center and India being a natural hedge against \\nthe adverse growth impact of US-China trade war. The full majority to BJP led NDA government reinforced the belief in some of the \\npolicies undertaken during their last term; particularly the actions to keep the inflation contained and focus on social security net.  \\nHowever, the slowing economic growth (4.7% in Q3 FY20), the slowest in almost 7 years, and stress in the non-banking financial entities \\nkept the markets jittery. The sharp economic slowdown necessitated policy action at a war scale. The Government responded with big \\nbang reforms on corporate taxes, which boosted market sentiment.  Further, India being integrated with the rest of the world was also \\nimpacted a bit by slowing global growth. \\nDespite a backdrop of weak economic growth, the Indian markets hit fresh highs in early 2020 on expectations of economic recovery. Both \\nservice sector and manufacturing sector PMIs had started looking up. Even the IIP numbers suggested that the economy was turning in \\nthe Jan-Feb 2020 period. However, the recovery was cut short by the sudden outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic.\\nMarkets plummeted consequently in line with the global markets, reacting as much to the lockdown and its economic fallout as to the \\npandemic itself. FPIs (Foreign Portfolio Investors) that had positive inflows for most part of the financial year, sold nearly US$ 8.3bn worth \\nof equities in March alone even as DIIs bought US$ 7.5bn. For the full financial year, FPIs were net buyers to the tune of US$ 1.3 billion \\nin equities. \\nThere will be economic consequences as the world deals with triple shocks simultaneously- supply shock, demand shock, and oil shock \\n(as oil prices plunged after the disagreement between OPEC nations on cutting down of oil supply). Aggressive policy intervention will \\nbe critical in limiting the damage.\\nThe government announced a ` 1.7 trillion stimulus aimed at easing the bottom of the pyramid through the lockdown. At 0.8% of GDP \\nthis would be modest compared to several other countries that have undertaken much larger stimuli; the US for example has approved a \\npackage which is 10% of their GDP. We hope that on the other side of the lockdown, there will be more help from the government. The \\npain that several businesses, especially smaller ones, face around their very survival and the corresponding rise in unemployment, need \\nto be addressed. While poverty in India has usually been associated with rural India, this crisis has brought to fore the plight of the urban \\npoor, who will need focused support as unemployment situation continues to worsen.\\nOn the fixed income markets side, the market rallied in the initial months of the financial year with the budget adhering to fiscal \\nconsolidation, global developments tilting towards monetary easing, accommodative RBI policy on the backdrop of slowing economic \\ngrowth and surplus systemic liquidity. \\nThe bond market remained volatile for the remaining part of the year on concerns about the prospects of fiscal slippage due to tax cut \\nannouncement and on the prospects of additional fiscal stimulus measures given the economic slowdown. With hike in the near-term CPI, \\nRBI kept the policy action on hold post the October 2019 policy and resorted to unconventional actions to ensure that term premiums \\nreduce. These measures were intended to bring down sovereign rates and thereby enable better transmission in the corporate markets \\nover time. \\nLiquidity conditions remained in surplus all through the second half of the financial year, with the effective overnight rates trading \\nsubstantially below the policy rate in all the secured overnight funding markets. The onset of market volatility post the large scale spread \\nof the Covid-19 pandemic across the globe rattled domestic debt markets as large scale FPI outflows were witnessed. \\nThe RBI advanced its scheduled April review and announced an out of schedule policy Repo rate cut by 75bps to 4.40%. Simultaneously \\nCRR was cut by 100 bps along with a Targeted LTRO(Long Term Repo Operations) of ` 1 trillion specifically for purchase of corporate bonds \\nin primary and secondary markets. These extraordinary measures announced at the end of March 2020 had the impact of unwinding the \\nstressed levels witnessed during the preceding few weeks with rates across the curve retracing substantially. While fiscal pressures would \\nmagnify in the current context with the shutdown, RBI direct and indirect accommodation of the same becomes an inevitable option at \\nsome point.\\nThe year was:\\nMarked by regular inflows of assets, the Indian Mutual Fund Industry witnessed a reasonable growth of approximately 10%* in terms \\nof Quarterly AAUM (Average Assets Under Management). The Quarterly AAUM for the industry reached ` 27,02,511 Crores* (March 31, \\n2020) from ` 24,48,121 Crores* (March 31, 2019).

We used different communication, advertising and thought-leadership \\nplatforms to engage with them. We continue to believe; this is the way ahead for the industry as we see different customer niches and \\nneeds emerge.\\nThe major investor awareness activities undertaken by us during the year are mentioned as under:\\n1. Development and Dissemination of Investor Education material \\na. Articles – This year we partnered with the India Today Group for a series of investor education articles on different areas of \\npersonal finance, investing and mutual funds. A separate section has been created in the English & Hindi editions of their \\nIndia Today magazine called ‘Nivesh Yatra – The Journey towards Financial Freedom’ for this initiative which publishes articles \\nfor their readers. In addition, we developed brochures from in-house content like ‘Planning for Retirement’ and ’14 Reasons \\nto fall in love with Mutual Funds’ to promote the effectiveness of mutual funds as an investment solution. The content when \\nrequired, is adapted to formats like online mailers/WhatsApp and is circulated to investors and distribution partners alike and \\nhosted on our website blog - Inspire.  ',\n",
              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED10\\nb. Videos – We worked with content partners to develop videos on hybrid funds and benefits of staying invested. The video \\ntitled ‘Bumpy Ride’ highlights the benefits of staying invested despite ups and downs in market conditions while the second \\nvideo titled “H itesh Ritesh” shows the investment journey of two friends where one chooses to stay invested during volatile \\nmarkets and reaches his financial goals, while the other friend chooses to opt out during tough market conditions. Their \\njourney is beautifully showcased lyrically. We also developed a light-hearted video on Children’s Day with two child artists who \\nare curious to know about things in their surroundings. The message that we wanted to convey was as an investor you must \\nhave many queries about your investments and mutual funds could be an answer for the same. All videos were promoted \\nthrough our social media channels.\\n2. Social Media – Our objective\\xa0on social media\\xa0is to drive more engagement on our\\xa0official social handles by using an approach of \\nunique content, rich formats, and engaging representation.\\xa0Following this approach, we have run quite a few quiz\\xa0series under \\nthe name #SBIMFQuizTime on\\xa0Twitter with an intention to engage with our existing and potential followers\\xa0on different aspects \\nof mutual funds and financial planning.\\xa0We also did some topical content on festivals and occasion such as:\\n a.

One of our investor awareness initiatives of the year was\\xa0#WhatsYourExcuse, aimed at those\\xa0audiences who keep \\ndelaying their investments\\xa0due to various reasons. Concepts like\\xa0online\\xa0investing and\\xa0possibility to register\\xa0SIP\\xa0even when on \\na\\xa0holiday\\xa0online/via an app were specifically made for them.\\xa0\\xa0In addition, we continuously promote concepts\\xa0like SIP,\\xa0Goal-based \\ninvesting through mutual funds\\xa0and ELSS (ELSS means LESS tax) through\\xa0prominent\\xa0domain and finance\\xa0sites like Café Mutual, \\nMorningstar India, Value Research and distribution-led sites like AdvisorKhoj. These activities are supplemented with\\xa0organic and \\naffiliate\\xa0email campaigns which\\xa0help in reach and awareness to a large group of online audiences.\\n4. Public Relations/Media – With the evolving media consumption habits, interaction across social media, print publications, and \\nonline media remains important. We continue to reach out to key media including regional (Newspapers, Magazines, Online and \\nTelevision) to establish thought leadership by getting relevant coverage in large format industry stories, authored articles and Q&A’s \\nwith spokespersons covering business, funds and investment and investor awareness aspects. We also continued to have a sustained \\nfocus on reaching out to potential investors through regional media sharing concepts for investor awareness like our ‘Nivesh Ke \\nNuske’ section in magazines like ‘Nivesh Manthan’\\xa0and highlighting the benefits of mutual funds, financial planning and other \\naspects of personal finance.\\xa0 \\xa0\\n5. Television & On-ground Events – Our association with CNBC Awaaz, a leading Hindi business channel from the CNBC-TV18 network, \\nfor Pehla Kadam – Season 5, a holistic investor education initiative across India, continued this year with an exclusive tie-up to \\npromote mutual funds as an investment option for financial goals. This included a mix of on-ground events, in-studio discussions, \\ncorporate campus events and online/social media. As part of the sponsorship, we plan to have 15 episodes (10 in-studio discussions \\nand 5 episodes compiled from on-ground events) on different facets of financial planning and mutual funds. The on-ground events \\nwill include corporate campus and public auditorium events to engage with first-time investors, homemakers, youth, retail investors, \\nentrepreneur community and retirees. The initiative is also promoted extensively via social media and promos on TV18 channels.\\n6. Media Campaigns – We had a couple of opportunities in the past year to use tactical media campaigns to promote mutual funds \\namongst the masses with the theme/message viral at that point of time.\\na) Cricket World Cup is an important property from an advertising standpoint, as it is once in 4 years, where a lot of ‘eyeballs’ are \\navailable across media. It was an opportune time for us to use this highly viewed event as a tactical opportunity to promote \\nmutual funds amongst the masses and correlate the similarities in Cricket with Mutual Funds. Our investor education campaign, \\n‘Khelo Financial Growth Ka Innings’ , during the World Cup brought out the similarities in scenarios between mutual funds \\nand cricket with advertisements like e.g. Singles can also help win a match (similar to using SIPs to build a corpus) and Long-\\nInnings and Long-term investing both don’t deserve a run out. This was promoted in online media (our website, third-party \\nadvertising and social media) and in select business/personal finance publications like MINT, Business Standard, Financial \\nExpress, Hindu Business Line and ET Wealth.',\n",
              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED11\\nb) Our next tactical campaign of the year was inspired from the Prime Minister’s Independence Day speech where he laid out \\na vision for India to become a $5 Trillion economy. Our message focused on the fact the policy reforms being put in place \\nby the Government for different sectors will enable them to grow. Thus, an allocation through equity funds can enable an \\ninvestor to build long-term wealth and our message ‘Participate in the journey towards a $5 Trillion economy with Equity \\nFunds’  was to reinforce that equity as an asset class through mutual funds is a convenient option to participate. The campaign \\nwas extensively promoted across outdoor (40 cities), online media (our website, third-party advertising and social media) and \\nprint media (English and 8 Regional language publications - Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Tamil, Kannada, Telegu and \\nPunjabi).\\nc) Equity Linked Saving Schemes (ELSS) continue to be an ideal investment option for those looking to build long-term wealth \\nwhile availing tax benefit on their investments. ‘ELSS means LESS tax’ was our message to investors so the tax-saving message \\nclearly stood out to investors. The message explained in detail in the magazine advertisements how investments in ELSS can \\nhelp save tax while elaborating on the benefits on investing in equity-linked schemes like ELSS to build wealth while getting \\ntax benefit on investments of up to `. 1.5 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The message was promoted through \\nbelow-the-line collaterals like banners, standees as well as in online/social media to increase the reach of the message.\\nd) The last quarter of FY 19-20 saw a lot of market movement, firstly with the downturn in the economy and later with the \\ncoronavirus situation limiting activity worldwide, with fall across large, mid and small cap companies. At such a time, we \\nthought to remind investors that such ‘black swan events’ are opportune times to stay invested as long-term goals should not \\nget affected by these bumps in the road. Our message ‘Don’t take a U-turn on your investments’ was to drive that point across \\nand we exclusively used online media (emailers and social media posts) to promote the same as other media were affected \\ndue to the lockdown in force across the country, while the entire audience was online tracking news and other information.\\n7. The AMC conducted 297 Investor Education meets with 17,487 participants in FY 19-20. In these events, trained professionals \\ndiscussed the importance of savings, financial goals, benefit of compounding in wealth creation, healthy wealthy habits amongst \\nother personal finance topics. Investment awareness videos were screened at these programs with trainers available to explain, \\nclarify or answer various queries. Booklets/Collaterals in regional languages on investor awareness were also distributed in these \\nprograms. We also did an investor awareness program at a Chartered Accountants Conference for nearly 3,200 participants. Our \\ninvestor awareness programs are conducted at State Bank of India Branches, Army Cantonments, CRPF, Air Force stations, Educational \\nInstitutes, Municipal Schools and at Corporate offices of Companies. These events continue to be well received by the investing/\\ngeneral public and are key to spreading financial literacy and awareness across the country.\\nNEW INITIATIVES  \\n1. In FY 2020, SBIFM was certified as a ‘Great Place To Work’ for the period March 2020 to Feb 2021. This is a result of High-Trust and \\nHigh-Performance Culture in the organisation. \\n2. On the digital front, 85% of all lumpsum purchase transactions and 75% of all SIP transactions were registered digitally. Despite \\ndiscontinuation of Aadhaar based on-boarding, last year over 10.85 lacs, i.e. 61% of new investors of SBI Mutual Fund were added \\ndigitally. We also launched voice assistants on Alexa and Google Home devices. We have also created ‘smart statement’ of accounts \\nwhich redefines online statement of accounts by including several insights on one’s investments.\\xa0 Further, we introduced the \\nWhatsApp Chatbot in March 2020, which already has over 14,000 registered users.\\n3. Our focus continued to be on the B30 locations as our endeavour is to grow organically through higher penetration in these \\ngeographies. To further boost our efforts in B30 locations, we have launched 14 new Branches in the year taking the total number \\nof Branches to 222 including 176 in B30 locations.\\n4. We have also gained a fair share of the industry SIP book as SIP is one of the strongest investment tools available to investors and it \\nalso adds to regular and sustainable long term inflows in core assets. In March 2020, our SIP book stood at  `1,180 crores as compared \\nto  ` 1,056 crores as of March 2019. \\n5. With a view to build a sustainable business for all the stakeholders and putting investors safety first, we continuously work towards  \\nenhancing our risk mitigation processes and the same has proven to be effective in FY 2020. \\n6. In FY 2020, SBIFM became the first AMC in the country to be fully compliant with the Global Investment Performance Standards( \\nGIPS), administered by the CFA Institute. GIPS is a global guide for the principles that investment companies need to follow while \\ncalculating and presenting performance data to clients. This adds another layer of credibility to our business functioning through \\na fair representation of the performance to our customers ',\n",
              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED12\\n7. With the focus on customer service, SBIFM continues to invest significantly in this segment to help investors throughout their \\ninvestment journey. We have addressed many customer pain points by gathering customer feedback, process improvements, system \\nenhancements, strengthened governance around repeated queries and upskilling of teams along with speedy resolution. We have \\nmade continuous improvement in On-boarding and Investment processes by providing enhanced digital solutions both for our \\ninvestors and distributors. Overall complaints continue to trend downwards. \\n8. We have substantially grown our PMS institutional book by On-boarding some of the most esteemed and the largest PF (Provident \\nFund) organisations. \\n9. From customer’s perspective, SBI Mutual Fund continues to believe in offering investment solutions rather than a product-selling \\napproach.\\xa0 Accordingly, we launched services such as SWP – A, SIP Top up cap, SIP Pause etc. during the year. \\nVII. CHANGE IN NATURE OF BUSINESS \\nThere was no change in the nature of business during the year under review.\\nVIII.

While everyone is trying innovative ways to ensure business continuity, the real challenge will be the new world \\nthat we will be a part of once this is over and we enter a new normal. \\n2. From the business perspective, we expect FY 20-21 to be a challenging year for the entire industry, both from the perspective of \\ngrowth in assets as well as pressure on margins. We will accordingly focus on cost optimization through forward and backward \\nintegration. However, we will continue to invest in the core needs of business enhancement. We will also make significant investments \\ninto technology to protect our data and develop highest standards of data security.\\n3.

We will work on a data platform project which will help in various analytics use-cases for business impact.\\xa0\\n4. In terms of our product basket, we will continue to add funds, both from the point of view of introducing innovative products and \\naddressing product gaps. We will have products across solution-oriented and debt categories. We will also continue to expand our \\npassive offerings. We will also focus on creating tools and solutions which will help investors in achieving their investment goals.\\n5.

              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED44\\n1.6.2  Other Income:\\n(a) Dividend income:\\n Dividend income from investments is recognised when the right to receive payment has been established, which \\nis generally when shareholders approve the dividend. On investments in certain mutual funds, the company is \\nentitled to a daily / weekly dividend. This dividend is accounted for at such frequency as the right to receive \\npayment is established.\\n(b)  Interest income:\\n Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to \\nthe Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by \\nreference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate (EIR) applicable, which is the rate that \\nexactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net \\ncarrying amount on initial recognition. Interest income is included in finance income in the statement of profit \\nand loss. In case of staff loans interest income is recognised on accrual basis.\\n1.7  Scheme Expenses \\n(a)  Recurring expenses of schemes borne by the Company are recognised under respective expense heads in the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss unless considered recoverable from the schemes in accordance with provisions of SEBI (Mutual Fund) \\nRegulations 1996 and circular issued from time to time.\\n Expenses of schemes of SBI Mutual Fund, in excess of the stipulated rates, are required to be borne by the Company in \\naccordance with the requirements of SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, and as such, are charged to the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss.\\n(b)  Brokerage: Brokerage and/or Incentive paid on investments in open-ended Equity Linked Tax Saving Schemes and \\nSystematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are amortized over a period of 36 months and in case of other schemes, over the claw \\nback period from beginning of the month brokerage is paid.

A contract is, or contains, a lease if \\nthe contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. \\nTo assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) \\nthe contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use \\nof the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. At the date of \\ncommencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all \\nlease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low \\nvalue leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense \\non a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \\n Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU \\nassets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. The right-of-use \\nassets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments \\nmade at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are \\nsubsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from \\nthe commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.

              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED45\\nRight of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying \\namounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair \\nvalue less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash \\nflows that are largely independent of those from other assets. \\n The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments \\nare discounted using the interest rate. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of \\nuse asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. Lease liability \\nand ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash \\nflows. \\n1.9 Foreign currencies\\n(a)  Functional and presentation currency\\n Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of primary economic environment in which \\nthe company operates (‘the Functional currency’).

Monetary items:\\n Foreign exchange gains or losses realized up on settlement of transactions or translation of monetary assets \\nand liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in profit and loss account using reporting date \\nexchange rates.\\nii. Non-monetary items : \\n Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the \\nexchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. \\n Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into functional currency \\nat the exchange rate when fair value is determined. \\n The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the \\nrecognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose \\nfair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).\\n1.10  Employee benefits  \\n(a)  Defined Contribution Plan :\\n- Provident Fund  \\n The Company has defined contribution plans for post-employment benefits in the form of Provident fund. Under \\nthe Provident Fund plan, the company contributes to Government administered Provident Fund on behalf of \\nemployees.

The Company accounts for liability for future gratuity \\nbenefits based on the actuarial valuation using Projected Unit Credit Method carried out as at the end of each \\nfinancial year. Actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognized in the Statement of Profit and loss. \\n Gratuity liabilities are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an independent actuary, at each reporting \\ndate using the projected unit credit method. The Company recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit \\nplan in its balance sheet as an asset or liability, as the case may be. The discount rate is based on the government \\nsecurities yield. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions \\nare recorded in other comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which \\nthey arise.\\n(c)  Other Long-term employee benefit obligation : Compensated absences\\n The company provides for the encashment of leave or leave with pay subject to certain rules.

The liability is provided based on the \\nnumber of days of unutilized leave at each balance sheet date on the basis of an independent actuarial valuation \\ncarried out as at the end of each financial year. \\n(d)  Employee Share Based Payments:\\n Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair \\nvalue of the equity instruments at the grant date.\\n The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on amortised \\nbasis over the vesting period, based on the Company's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, \\nwith a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of \\nthe number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is \\nrecognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding \\nadjustment to the equity-settled employee benefits reserve.\\n1.11  Income taxes\\n Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year. \\nCurrent and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised \\nin other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other \\ncomprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\\n(a) Current tax\\n Current income tax for current and prior period is recognised at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid \\nto the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted at the \\nreporting date.\\n Current income taxes are recognised in the statement of profit and loss except for items those are recognised outside \\nprofit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity), related tax for such items are recognised either in \\nOther Comprehensive income or in Equity.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE\",\n",

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are \\nmeasured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, \\nbased on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. \\n The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent \\nthat it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset \\nto be recovered. \\n Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences except for investment in subsidiaries \\nand associates, when the timings of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that \\nthe temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. \\n1.12  Property, plant and equipment\\n(a)  Recognition and measurement\\n All items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment \\nlosses, if any. Historical cost includes expenses directly attributable to the acquisition of an asset.\\n Advances paid towards the acquisition of property and equipment and the cost of property and equipment not ready \\nfor use before the reporting date are disclosed separately in the property and equipment schedule.\\n Improvements to leasehold premises are amortised over the primary lease period subject to a maximum period of five \\nyears.\\n(b) Depreciation\\n Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognised using Straight Line Method (SLM) to expense the cost less \\nresidual values over estimated useful lives as prescribed under Schedule II of Companies Act, 2013.

Amortisation expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated \\nuseful lives in the statement of profit and loss. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at \\nthe end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective \\nbasis. \\n(b)  Useful lives of intangible assets\\n Estimated useful lives of the intangible assets adopted by management are as follows:\\nDescription of assets Useful lives \\n (In years)Method of depreciation / \\namortization \\nComputer software 3 - 6 years SLM\\nWebsite development cost 3 years SLM\\nCopyright licenses 5 years SLM\\n1.14  De-recognition of PPE and Intangible Assets\\n Carrying amount (net of accumulated depreciation and amortisation) of property, plant and equipment and intangible \\nasset is derecognised upon its disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued \\nuse of the asset.\\n Any gains or losses arising on such disposal is determined based on difference between net proceeds and carrying \\namount and such gains or losses are recognised in statement of profit and loss. \\n1.15  Provisions, Contingent liability and contingent asset \\n Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past events, \\nit is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and \\na reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\\n The expenses relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement.\\n Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the \\npresent obligation at the end of reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is pre-tax rate \\nthat reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specified to the liability. The increase \\nin provision due to passage of time is recognised as finance cost. \\n When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third \\nparty, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount \\nof the receivable can be measured reliably.\\n Contingent liabilities\\n A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the \\noccurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present \\nobligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the \\nobligation.

              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED50\\n For trade receivables Company applies ‘simplified approach’ which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised \\nfrom initial recognition of the receivables. The Company uses historical default rates to determine impairment loss on \\nthe portfolio of trade receivables. At every reporting date, these historical default rates are reviewed and changes in \\nthe forward-looking estimates are analysed. \\n For other assets, the Company uses 12-month ECL to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase \\nin credit risk. If there is significant increase in credit risk full lifetime ECL is used.\\n Financial liabilities\\n Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost. For trade and other payables maturing within one year \\nfrom the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\\n Derecognition of financial liabilities\\n The Company derecognises financial liabilities when the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have \\nexpired. \\n Equity instruments :\\n All equity investments in scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading \\nare classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company decides to classify the same either as at FVTOCI \\nor FVTPL. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by instrument basis. The classification is made on initial \\nrecognition and is irrevocable. If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value \\nchanges on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from \\nOCI to Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative \\ngain or loss within equity.\\n Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss.\\n1.17  Earnings per share\\n The basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity \\nshares outstanding during the year.\\n Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue equity \\nshares were exercised or converted during the period/year. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted \\naverage number of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding at the year end.\\n1.18  Dividends\\n Final dividends on shares are recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the shareholders and interim dividends \\nare recorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the company’s Board of Directors.\\n1.19  Standards Issued but not Effective\\n There is no such notification issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) which would have been applicable \\nfrom April 1, 2020.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE',\n",

The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition \\nof the Investment strategy .   \\nRisks associated with defined benefit plan    \\nGratuity is a defined benefit plan and company is exposed to the Following Risks:    \\nInterest rate risk:  A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the G.Sec Rate will Increase the present value of the liability requiring \\nhigher provision. A fall in the discount rate generally increase the mark to market value of the assets depending on the duration of \\nasset.    \\nSalary Risk:  The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of members As such an \\nincrease in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.    \\nInvestment Risk:  The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by \\nreference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will \\ncreate a plan deficit. Currently, for the plan in India it has a relatively balanced mix of investments in government securities, and other \\ndebt instruments.    \\nAsset Liability Matching Risk:  The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow Since the plan is invested in lines of Rule 101 of \\nIncome Tax Rules, 1962. this generally reduces ALM risk.    \\nMortality risk:  Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan do not have any \\nlongevity risk    \\nConcentration Risk:  Plan is having a concentration risk all the assets are invested in the insurance company and a default will wipe out \\nall the assets. Although probability of this is very less as Insurance companies have to follow regulatory guidelines.   \\nGratuity is taken care by separate trust fund and contribution is guided by Rule 103 of Income Tax Rules 1962.   \\nThe principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows.\\nParticulars Valuation as at\\n31 Mar 2020 31 Mar 2019\\nDiscount rate(s) 6.89% 7.79%\\nExpected rate(s) of salary increase 5% p.a 5% p.aNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE\",\n",

Liquidity Risk \\nLiquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The company maintains sufficient \\nbank balance and marketable securities such as liquid/ultra-short duration and other debt funds.\\n2. Credit Risk \\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing financial \\nloss to the company. The company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business \\nactivities. The company has well defined investment policy restricting investments in various risk categories such high/moderate high/\\nmoderate etc.\\n3. Foreign currency risk management:    \\nThe company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. \\nExchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.\\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the \\nreporting period are as follows.     \\n(` in Lakhs)\\nCurrency Liabilities Assets\\nAs at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019As at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019\\nAED - 7.73 13.23\\nUSD 18.81 44.44 866.81 622.97\\nBHD 22.95 10.28                    -                     -   \\nAUD -                       -   3.52 2.67\\nJPY                   -                         -   76.98 82.73\\nSGD                   -                         -   127.29 151.66\\n \\nForeign currency sensitivity analysis:    \\nThe following table details the Company’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the Rupee against the relevant foreign \\ncurrencies. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents \\nmanagement’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding \\nforeign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency \\nrates.

On investments in certain mutual funds, the company is \\nentitled to a daily / weekly dividend. This dividend is accounted for at such frequency as the right to receive \\npayment is established.\\n(b)  Interest income:\\n Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to \\nthe Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by \\nreference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate (EIR) applicable, which is the rate that \\nexactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net \\ncarrying amount on initial recognition.

They are \\nsubsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from \\nthe commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. \\nRight of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying \\namounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair \\nvalue less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash \\nflows that are largely independent of those from other assets. \\n The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments \\nare discounted using the interest rate. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of \\nuse asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.

The discount rate used to determine the present value is pre-tax rate that reflects \\ncurrent market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specified to the liability. The increase in provision due to \\npassage of time is recognised as finance cost. \\n When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a \\nreceivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable \\ncan be measured reliably.\\n Contingent liabilities\\n A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence \\nor non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present obligation that is \\nnot recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation.

All financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables \\nwhich are initially measured at transaction price. \\n Subsequent measurement\\n Financial assets carried at amortised cost\\n A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold \\nthe asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates \\nto cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\\n Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\\n A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is held within a business \\nmodel whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual \\nterms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the \\nprincipal amount outstanding.\\n The Company has made an irrevocable election for its investments which are classified as equity instruments to present the \\nsubsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income based on its business model.

The Company uses historical default rates to determine impairment loss on the portfolio \\nof trade receivables. At every reporting date, these historical default rates are reviewed and changes in the forward-looking \\nestimates are analysed. \\n For other assets, the Company uses 12-month ECL to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase in \\ncredit risk. If there is significant increase in credit risk full lifetime ECL is used.\\n Financial liabilities\\n Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost. For trade and other payables maturing within one year from \\nthe Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\\n Derecognition of financial liabilities\\n The Company derecognises financial liabilities when the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired. \\n Equity instruments :\\n All equity investments in scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading are \\nclassified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company decides to classify the same either as at FVTOCI or FVTPL. \\nThe Company makes such election on an instrument-by instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition \\nand is irrevocable. If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the \\ninstrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to Statement of \\nProfit and Loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.\\n Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss.\\n1.16  Earnings per share\\n The basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares \\noutstanding during the year.\\n Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue equity shares \\nwere exercised or converted during the period/year. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average \\nnumber of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding at the year end.\\n1.17  Dividends\\n Final dividends on shares are recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the shareholders and interim dividends are \\nrecorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the company’s Board of Directors.\\n1.18  Standards Issued but not Effective\\n There is no such notification issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) which would have been applicable from \\nApril 1, 2020NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS',\n",

The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition \\nof the Investment strategy .\\nRisks associated with defined benefit plan    \\nGratuity is a defined benefit plan and company is exposed to the Following Risks:    \\nInterest rate risk: A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the G.Sec Rate will Increase the present value of the liability requiring \\nhigher provision. A fall in the discount rate generally increase the mark to market value of the assets depending on the duration of \\nasset.    \\nSalary Risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of members As such an \\nincrease in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.    \\nInvestment Risk:  The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by \\nreference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will \\ncreate a plan deficit Currently, for the plan in India it has a relatively balanced mix of investments in government securities, and other \\ndebt instruments.    \\nAsset Liability Matching Risk:  The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow Since the plan is invested in lines of Rule 101 of \\nIncome Tax Rules, 1962. this generally reduces ALM risk.    \\nMortality risk: Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan do not have any \\nlongevity risk    \\nConcentration Risk: Plan is having a concentration risk all the assets are invested in the insurance company and a default will wipe out \\nall the assets.

The Company has been regular in servicing its \\ndues thus far and the short term investment thesis continues to remain intact. In view of the same, we believe that there is no impairment \\nin the investment and it can be valued at its cost as at reporting date.

Liquidity Risk\\nLiquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The company maintains sufficient \\nbank balance and marketable securities such as liquid/ultra-short duration and other debt funds.”  \\n2. Credit Risk \\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing financial \\nloss to the company. The company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business \\nactivities. The company has well defined investment policy restricting investments in various risk categories such high/moderate high/\\nmoderate etc.       \\n3. Foreign currency risk management:    \\nThe company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. \\nExchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.\\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the \\nreporting period are as follows.                                                                                                                        \\n(` in Lakhs)\\nCurrency Liabilities Assets\\nAs at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019As at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019\\nAED - - 7.73 13.23\\nUSD 18.81 44.44 866.81 622.97\\nBHD 22.95 10.28  -    -   \\nAUD  -    -   3.52 2.67\\nJPY  -    -   76.98 82.73\\nSGD  -    -   127.29 151.66\\n ',\n",

The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding \\nforeign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency \\nrates. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or equity where the Rupee strengthens 10% against the relevant currency. \\nFor a 10% weakening of the Rupee against the relevant currency, there would be a comparable impact on the profit or equity, and the \\nbalances below would be negative.  \\n(` in Lakhs)\\nCurrency Impact on profit or loss for the year Impact on total equity as at the end of \\nthe reporting period\\nAs at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019As at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019\\nAED Currency impact  0.58  0.91  0.58  0.91 \\nUSD Currency impact  65.39  39.83  65.39  39.83 \\nBHD Currency impact  1.72  0.67  1.72  0.67 \\nAUD Currency impact  0.26  0.02  0.26  0.02 \\nJPY Currency impact  5.76  2.29  5.76  2.29 \\nSGD Currency impact  9.53  5.47  9.53  5.47 \\nIn management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk because the exposure at the \\nend of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during the year and  considering the size of business and  size of  exposure \\nin Foreign currency is immaterial.    \\n36.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT:\\nFinancial year 2019-20 has seen it all, from the markets reaching its all-time high to three-year returns being erased within a span of a \\nmonth. This year we saw the GDP touching its lowest level in seven years while crude oil fell to levels last seen about 18 years back. The \\nbiggest shock came at the end of the year, the COVID-19 global pandemic on a scale that’s seen once in a lifetime.\\nOverall, the NIFTY delivered negative returns of around 26% for FY19-20. Midcaps and Smallcaps that had started outperforming largecaps \\nby early 2020, gave away all the outperformance and underperformed the largecap indices. When compared to other emerging markets, \\nIndia was a stark underperformer with MSCI India delivering negative returns of nearly 32% (in US$ terms) compared with MSCI Emerging \\nMarket Index’s -20%.',\n",
              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED6\\nThe fiscal year had started on a positive note helped by a strong political mandate at the center and India being a natural hedge against \\nthe adverse growth impact of US-China trade war. The full majority to BJP led NDA government reinforced the belief in some of the \\npolicies undertaken during their last term; particularly the actions to keep the inflation contained and focus on social security net.  \\nHowever, the slowing economic growth (4.7% in Q3 FY20), the slowest in almost 7 years, and stress in the non-banking financial entities \\nkept the markets jittery. The sharp economic slowdown necessitated policy action at a war scale. The Government responded with big \\nbang reforms on corporate taxes, which boosted market sentiment.  Further, India being integrated with the rest of the world was also \\nimpacted a bit by slowing global growth. \\nDespite a backdrop of weak economic growth, the Indian markets hit fresh highs in early 2020 on expectations of economic recovery. Both \\nservice sector and manufacturing sector PMIs had started looking up. Even the IIP numbers suggested that the economy was turning in \\nthe Jan-Feb 2020 period. However, the recovery was cut short by the sudden outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic.\\nMarkets plummeted consequently in line with the global markets, reacting as much to the lockdown and its economic fallout as to the \\npandemic itself. FPIs (Foreign Portfolio Investors) that had positive inflows for most part of the financial year, sold nearly US$ 8.3bn worth \\nof equities in March alone even as DIIs bought US$ 7.5bn. For the full financial year, FPIs were net buyers to the tune of US$ 1.3 billion \\nin equities. \\nThere will be economic consequences as the world deals with triple shocks simultaneously- supply shock, demand shock, and oil shock \\n(as oil prices plunged after the disagreement between OPEC nations on cutting down of oil supply). Aggressive policy intervention will \\nbe critical in limiting the damage.\\nThe government announced a ` 1.7 trillion stimulus aimed at easing the bottom of the pyramid through the lockdown. At 0.8% of GDP \\nthis would be modest compared to several other countries that have undertaken much larger stimuli; the US for example has approved a \\npackage which is 10% of their GDP. We hope that on the other side of the lockdown, there will be more help from the government. The \\npain that several businesses, especially smaller ones, face around their very survival and the corresponding rise in unemployment, need \\nto be addressed. While poverty in India has usually been associated with rural India, this crisis has brought to fore the plight of the urban \\npoor, who will need focused support as unemployment situation continues to worsen.\\nOn the fixed income markets side, the market rallied in the initial months of the financial year with the budget adhering to fiscal \\nconsolidation, global developments tilting towards monetary easing, accommodative RBI policy on the backdrop of slowing economic \\ngrowth and surplus systemic liquidity. \\nThe bond market remained volatile for the remaining part of the year on concerns about the prospects of fiscal slippage due to tax cut \\nannouncement and on the prospects of additional fiscal stimulus measures given the economic slowdown. With hike in the near-term CPI, \\nRBI kept the policy action on hold post the October 2019 policy and resorted to unconventional actions to ensure that term premiums \\nreduce. These measures were intended to bring down sovereign rates and thereby enable better transmission in the corporate markets \\nover time. \\nLiquidity conditions remained in surplus all through the second half of the financial year, with the effective overnight rates trading \\nsubstantially below the policy rate in all the secured overnight funding markets. The onset of market volatility post the large scale spread \\nof the Covid-19 pandemic across the globe rattled domestic debt markets as large scale FPI outflows were witnessed. \\nThe RBI advanced its scheduled April review and announced an out of schedule policy Repo rate cut by 75bps to 4.40%. Simultaneously \\nCRR was cut by 100 bps along with a Targeted LTRO(Long Term Repo Operations) of ` 1 trillion specifically for purchase of corporate bonds \\nin primary and secondary markets. These extraordinary measures announced at the end of March 2020 had the impact of unwinding the \\nstressed levels witnessed during the preceding few weeks with rates across the curve retracing substantially. While fiscal pressures would \\nmagnify in the current context with the shutdown, RBI direct and indirect accommodation of the same becomes an inevitable option at \\nsome point.\\nThe year was:\\nMarked by regular inflows of assets, the Indian Mutual Fund Industry witnessed a reasonable growth of approximately 10%* in terms \\nof Quarterly AAUM (Average Assets Under Management). The Quarterly AAUM for the industry reached ` 27,02,511 Crores* (March 31, \\n2020) from ` 24,48,121 Crores* (March 31, 2019).

Development and Dissemination of Investor Education material \\na. Articles – This year we partnered with the India Today Group for a series of investor education articles on different areas of \\npersonal finance, investing and mutual funds. A separate section has been created in the English & Hindi editions of their \\nIndia Today magazine called ‘Nivesh Yatra – The Journey towards Financial Freedom’ for this initiative which publishes articles \\nfor their readers. In addition, we developed brochures from in-house content like ‘Planning for Retirement’ and ’14 Reasons \\nto fall in love with Mutual Funds’ to promote the effectiveness of mutual funds as an investment solution. The content when \\nrequired, is adapted to formats like online mailers/WhatsApp and is circulated to investors and distribution partners alike and \\nhosted on our website blog - Inspire.  ',\n",
              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED10\\nb. Videos – We worked with content partners to develop videos on hybrid funds and benefits of staying invested. The video \\ntitled ‘Bumpy Ride’ highlights the benefits of staying invested despite ups and downs in market conditions while the second \\nvideo titled “H itesh Ritesh” shows the investment journey of two friends where one chooses to stay invested during volatile \\nmarkets and reaches his financial goals, while the other friend chooses to opt out during tough market conditions. Their \\njourney is beautifully showcased lyrically. We also developed a light-hearted video on Children’s Day with two child artists who \\nare curious to know about things in their surroundings. The message that we wanted to convey was as an investor you must \\nhave many queries about your investments and mutual funds could be an answer for the same. All videos were promoted \\nthrough our social media channels.\\n2. Social Media – Our objective\\xa0on social media\\xa0is to drive more engagement on our\\xa0official social handles by using an approach of \\nunique content, rich formats, and engaging representation.\\xa0Following this approach, we have run quite a few quiz\\xa0series under \\nthe name #SBIMFQuizTime on\\xa0Twitter with an intention to engage with our existing and potential followers\\xa0on different aspects \\nof mutual funds and financial planning.\\xa0We also did some topical content on festivals and occasion such as:\\n a.

Public Relations/Media – With the evolving media consumption habits, interaction across social media, print publications, and \\nonline media remains important. We continue to reach out to key media including regional (Newspapers, Magazines, Online and \\nTelevision) to establish thought leadership by getting relevant coverage in large format industry stories, authored articles and Q&A’s \\nwith spokespersons covering business, funds and investment and investor awareness aspects. We also continued to have a sustained \\nfocus on reaching out to potential investors through regional media sharing concepts for investor awareness like our ‘Nivesh Ke \\nNuske’ section in magazines like ‘Nivesh Manthan’\\xa0and highlighting the benefits of mutual funds, financial planning and other \\naspects of personal finance.\\xa0 \\xa0\\n5. Television & On-ground Events – Our association with CNBC Awaaz, a leading Hindi business channel from the CNBC-TV18 network, \\nfor Pehla Kadam – Season 5, a holistic investor education initiative across India, continued this year with an exclusive tie-up to \\npromote mutual funds as an investment option for financial goals. This included a mix of on-ground events, in-studio discussions, \\ncorporate campus events and online/social media. As part of the sponsorship, we plan to have 15 episodes (10 in-studio discussions \\nand 5 episodes compiled from on-ground events) on different facets of financial planning and mutual funds. The on-ground events \\nwill include corporate campus and public auditorium events to engage with first-time investors, homemakers, youth, retail investors, \\nentrepreneur community and retirees. The initiative is also promoted extensively via social media and promos on TV18 channels.\\n6. Media Campaigns – We had a couple of opportunities in the past year to use tactical media campaigns to promote mutual funds \\namongst the masses with the theme/message viral at that point of time.\\na) Cricket World Cup is an important property from an advertising standpoint, as it is once in 4 years, where a lot of ‘eyeballs’ are \\navailable across media. It was an opportune time for us to use this highly viewed event as a tactical opportunity to promote \\nmutual funds amongst the masses and correlate the similarities in Cricket with Mutual Funds. Our investor education campaign, \\n‘Khelo Financial Growth Ka Innings’ , during the World Cup brought out the similarities in scenarios between mutual funds \\nand cricket with advertisements like e.g. Singles can also help win a match (similar to using SIPs to build a corpus) and Long-\\nInnings and Long-term investing both don’t deserve a run out. This was promoted in online media (our website, third-party \\nadvertising and social media) and in select business/personal finance publications like MINT, Business Standard, Financial \\nExpress, Hindu Business Line and ET Wealth.',\n",
              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED11\\nb) Our next tactical campaign of the year was inspired from the Prime Minister’s Independence Day speech where he laid out \\na vision for India to become a $5 Trillion economy. Our message focused on the fact the policy reforms being put in place \\nby the Government for different sectors will enable them to grow. Thus, an allocation through equity funds can enable an \\ninvestor to build long-term wealth and our message ‘Participate in the journey towards a $5 Trillion economy with Equity \\nFunds’  was to reinforce that equity as an asset class through mutual funds is a convenient option to participate. The campaign \\nwas extensively promoted across outdoor (40 cities), online media (our website, third-party advertising and social media) and \\nprint media (English and 8 Regional language publications - Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Tamil, Kannada, Telegu and \\nPunjabi).\\nc) Equity Linked Saving Schemes (ELSS) continue to be an ideal investment option for those looking to build long-term wealth \\nwhile availing tax benefit on their investments. ‘ELSS means LESS tax’ was our message to investors so the tax-saving message \\nclearly stood out to investors. The message explained in detail in the magazine advertisements how investments in ELSS can \\nhelp save tax while elaborating on the benefits on investing in equity-linked schemes like ELSS to build wealth while getting \\ntax benefit on investments of up to `. 1.5 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The message was promoted through \\nbelow-the-line collaterals like banners, standees as well as in online/social media to increase the reach of the message.\\nd) The last quarter of FY 19-20 saw a lot of market movement, firstly with the downturn in the economy and later with the \\ncoronavirus situation limiting activity worldwide, with fall across large, mid and small cap companies. At such a time, we \\nthought to remind investors that such ‘black swan events’ are opportune times to stay invested as long-term goals should not \\nget affected by these bumps in the road. Our message ‘Don’t take a U-turn on your investments’ was to drive that point across \\nand we exclusively used online media (emailers and social media posts) to promote the same as other media were affected \\ndue to the lockdown in force across the country, while the entire audience was online tracking news and other information.\\n7. The AMC conducted 297 Investor Education meets with 17,487 participants in FY 19-20. In these events, trained professionals \\ndiscussed the importance of savings, financial goals, benefit of compounding in wealth creation, healthy wealthy habits amongst \\nother personal finance topics. Investment awareness videos were screened at these programs with trainers available to explain, \\nclarify or answer various queries. Booklets/Collaterals in regional languages on investor awareness were also distributed in these \\nprograms. We also did an investor awareness program at a Chartered Accountants Conference for nearly 3,200 participants. Our \\ninvestor awareness programs are conducted at State Bank of India Branches, Army Cantonments, CRPF, Air Force stations, Educational \\nInstitutes, Municipal Schools and at Corporate offices of Companies. These events continue to be well received by the investing/\\ngeneral public and are key to spreading financial literacy and awareness across the country.\\nNEW INITIATIVES  \\n1. In FY 2020, SBIFM was certified as a ‘Great Place To Work’ for the period March 2020 to Feb 2021. This is a result of High-Trust and \\nHigh-Performance Culture in the organisation. \\n2.

Despite \\ndiscontinuation of Aadhaar based on-boarding, last year over 10.85 lacs, i.e. 61% of new investors of SBI Mutual Fund were added \\ndigitally. We also launched voice assistants on Alexa and Google Home devices. We have also created ‘smart statement’ of accounts \\nwhich redefines online statement of accounts by including several insights on one’s investments.\\xa0 Further, we introduced the \\nWhatsApp Chatbot in March 2020, which already has over 14,000 registered users.\\n3.

To further boost our efforts in B30 locations, we have launched 14 new Branches in the year taking the total number \\nof Branches to 222 including 176 in B30 locations.\\n4. We have also gained a fair share of the industry SIP book as SIP is one of the strongest investment tools available to investors and it \\nalso adds to regular and sustainable long term inflows in core assets. In March 2020, our SIP book stood at  `1,180 crores as compared \\nto  ` 1,056 crores as of March 2019. \\n5. With a view to build a sustainable business for all the stakeholders and putting investors safety first, we continuously work towards  \\nenhancing our risk mitigation processes and the same has proven to be effective in FY 2020. \\n6. In FY 2020, SBIFM became the first AMC in the country to be fully compliant with the Global Investment Performance Standards( \\nGIPS), administered by the CFA Institute. GIPS is a global guide for the principles that investment companies need to follow while \\ncalculating and presenting performance data to clients.

On investments in certain mutual funds, the company is \\nentitled to a daily / weekly dividend. This dividend is accounted for at such frequency as the right to receive \\npayment is established.\\n(b)  Interest income:\\n Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to \\nthe Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by \\nreference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate (EIR) applicable, which is the rate that \\nexactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net \\ncarrying amount on initial recognition. Interest income is included in finance income in the statement of profit \\nand loss. In case of staff loans interest income is recognised on accrual basis.\\n1.7  Scheme Expenses \\n(a)  Recurring expenses of schemes borne by the Company are recognised under respective expense heads in the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss unless considered recoverable from the schemes in accordance with provisions of SEBI (Mutual Fund) \\nRegulations 1996 and circular issued from time to time.\\n Expenses of schemes of SBI Mutual Fund, in excess of the stipulated rates, are required to be borne by the Company in \\naccordance with the requirements of SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, and as such, are charged to the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss.\\n(b)  Brokerage: Brokerage and/or Incentive paid on investments in open-ended Equity Linked Tax Saving Schemes and \\nSystematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are amortized over a period of 36 months and in case of other schemes, over the claw \\nback period from beginning of the month brokerage is paid.

A contract is, or contains, a lease if \\nthe contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. \\nTo assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) \\nthe contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use \\nof the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. At the date of \\ncommencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all \\nlease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low \\nvalue leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense \\non a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \\n Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU \\nassets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. The right-of-use \\nassets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments \\nmade at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are \\nsubsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from \\nthe commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.

              " 'SBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED45\\nRight of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying \\namounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair \\nvalue less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash \\nflows that are largely independent of those from other assets. \\n The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments \\nare discounted using the interest rate. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of \\nuse asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. Lease liability \\nand ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash \\nflows. \\n1.9 Foreign currencies\\n(a)  Functional and presentation currency\\n Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of primary economic environment in which \\nthe company operates (‘the Functional currency’).

Monetary items:\\n Foreign exchange gains or losses realized up on settlement of transactions or translation of monetary assets \\nand liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in profit and loss account using reporting date \\nexchange rates.\\nii. Non-monetary items : \\n Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the \\nexchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. \\n Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into functional currency \\nat the exchange rate when fair value is determined. \\n The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the \\nrecognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose \\nfair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).\\n1.10  Employee benefits  \\n(a)  Defined Contribution Plan :\\n- Provident Fund  \\n The Company has defined contribution plans for post-employment benefits in the form of Provident fund. Under \\nthe Provident Fund plan, the company contributes to Government administered Provident Fund on behalf of \\nemployees.

Actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognized in the Statement of Profit and loss. \\n Gratuity liabilities are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an independent actuary, at each reporting \\ndate using the projected unit credit method. The Company recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit \\nplan in its balance sheet as an asset or liability, as the case may be. The discount rate is based on the government \\nsecurities yield. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions \\nare recorded in other comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which \\nthey arise.\\n(c)  Other Long-term employee benefit obligation : Compensated absences\\n The company provides for the encashment of leave or leave with pay subject to certain rules.

At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of \\nthe number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is \\nrecognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding \\nadjustment to the equity-settled employee benefits reserve.\\n1.11  Income taxes\\n Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year. \\nCurrent and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised \\nin other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other \\ncomprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\\n(a) Current tax\\n Current income tax for current and prior period is recognised at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid \\nto the taxation authorities.

The discount rate used to determine the present value is pre-tax rate \\nthat reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specified to the liability. The increase \\nin provision due to passage of time is recognised as finance cost. \\n When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third \\nparty, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount \\nof the receivable can be measured reliably.\\n Contingent liabilities\\n A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the \\noccurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present \\nobligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the \\nobligation.

The Company uses historical default rates to determine impairment loss on \\nthe portfolio of trade receivables. At every reporting date, these historical default rates are reviewed and changes in \\nthe forward-looking estimates are analysed. \\n For other assets, the Company uses 12-month ECL to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase \\nin credit risk. If there is significant increase in credit risk full lifetime ECL is used.\\n Financial liabilities\\n Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost. For trade and other payables maturing within one year \\nfrom the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\\n Derecognition of financial liabilities\\n The Company derecognises financial liabilities when the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have \\nexpired. \\n Equity instruments :\\n All equity investments in scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value.

The Company makes such election on an instrument-by instrument basis. The classification is made on initial \\nrecognition and is irrevocable. If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value \\nchanges on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from \\nOCI to Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of investment.

The fund has the form of a trust and it is \\ngoverned by the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition \\nof the Investment strategy .   \\nRisks associated with defined benefit plan    \\nGratuity is a defined benefit plan and company is exposed to the Following Risks:    \\nInterest rate risk:  A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the G.Sec Rate will Increase the present value of the liability requiring \\nhigher provision. A fall in the discount rate generally increase the mark to market value of the assets depending on the duration of \\nasset.    \\nSalary Risk:  The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of members As such an \\nincrease in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.    \\nInvestment Risk:  The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by \\nreference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will \\ncreate a plan deficit. Currently, for the plan in India it has a relatively balanced mix of investments in government securities, and other \\ndebt instruments.    \\nAsset Liability Matching Risk:  The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow Since the plan is invested in lines of Rule 101 of \\nIncome Tax Rules, 1962. this generally reduces ALM risk.    \\nMortality risk:  Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan do not have any \\nlongevity risk    \\nConcentration Risk:  Plan is having a concentration risk all the assets are invested in the insurance company and a default will wipe out \\nall the assets.

The Company has been regular in servicing its \\ndues thus far and the short term investment thesis continues to remain intact. In view of the same, we believe that there is no impairment \\nin the investment and it can be valued at its cost as at reporting date. (PY-On the basis of the value provided by the AMFI authorised \\nagencies in accordance to the valuation guidelines.) \\nCapital management :       \\nThe Company’s capital management strategy is to effectively determine, raise and deploy capital so as to create value for its shareholders. \\nThe same is done through equity.       \\nFinancial Risk Management Framework :       \\nThe different types of risks the company is exposed to are liquidity risk credit risk and foreign currency risk.   \\n1. Liquidity Risk \\nLiquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The company maintains sufficient \\nbank balance and marketable securities such as liquid/ultra-short duration and other debt funds.\\n2. Credit Risk \\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing financial \\nloss to the company. The company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business \\nactivities. The company has well defined investment policy restricting investments in various risk categories such high/moderate high/\\nmoderate etc.\\n3. Foreign currency risk management:    \\nThe company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. \\nExchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.\\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the \\nreporting period are as follows.     \\n(` in Lakhs)\\nCurrency Liabilities Assets\\nAs at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019As at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019\\nAED - 7.73 13.23\\nUSD 18.81 44.44 866.81 622.97\\nBHD 22.95 10.28                    -                     -   \\nAUD -                       -   3.52 2.67\\nJPY                   -                         -   76.98 82.73\\nSGD                   -                         -   127.29 151.66\\n \\nForeign currency sensitivity analysis:    \\nThe following table details the Company’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the Rupee against the relevant foreign \\ncurrencies. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents \\nmanagement’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding \\nforeign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency \\nrates.

For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair \\nvalue less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash \\nflows that are largely independent of those from other assets. \\n The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments.

The company has well defined investment policy restricting investments in various risk categories such high/moderate high/\\nmoderate etc.       \\n3.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT:\\nFinancial year 2019-20 has seen it all, from the markets reaching its all-time high to three-year returns being erased within a span of a \\nmonth. This year we saw the GDP touching its lowest level in seven years while crude oil fell to levels last seen about 18 years back. The \\nbiggest shock came at the end of the year, the COVID-19 global pandemic on a scale that’s seen once in a lifetime.\\nOverall, the NIFTY delivered negative returns of around 26% for FY19-20. Midcaps and Smallcaps that had started outperforming largecaps \\nby early 2020, gave away all the outperformance and underperformed the largecap indices. When compared to other emerging markets, \\nIndia was a stark underperformer with MSCI India delivering negative returns of nearly 32% (in US$ terms) compared with MSCI Emerging \\nMarket Index’s -20%./nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED6\\nThe fiscal year had started on a positive note helped by a strong political mandate at the center and India being a natural hedge against \\nthe adverse growth impact of US-China trade war. The full majority to BJP led NDA government reinforced the belief in some of the \\npolicies undertaken during their last term; particularly the actions to keep the inflation contained and focus on social security net.  \\nHowever, the slowing economic growth (4.7% in Q3 FY20), the slowest in almost 7 years, and stress in the non-banking financial entities \\nkept the markets jittery. The sharp economic slowdown necessitated policy action at a war scale. The Government responded with big \\nbang reforms on corporate taxes, which boosted market sentiment.  Further, India being integrated with the rest of the world was also \\nimpacted a bit by slowing global growth. \\nDespite a backdrop of weak economic growth, the Indian markets hit fresh highs in early 2020 on expectations of economic recovery. Both \\nservice sector and manufacturing sector PMIs had started looking up. Even the IIP numbers suggested that the economy was turning in \\nthe Jan-Feb 2020 period. However, the recovery was cut short by the sudden outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic.\\nMarkets plummeted consequently in line with the global markets, reacting as much to the lockdown and its economic fallout as to the \\npandemic itself. FPIs (Foreign Portfolio Investors) that had positive inflows for most part of the financial year, sold nearly US$ 8.3bn worth \\nof equities in March alone even as DIIs bought US$ 7.5bn. For the full financial year, FPIs were net buyers to the tune of US$ 1.3 billion \\nin equities. \\nThere will be economic consequences as the world deals with triple shocks simultaneously- supply shock, demand shock, and oil shock \\n(as oil prices plunged after the disagreement between OPEC nations on cutting down of oil supply). Aggressive policy intervention will \\nbe critical in limiting the damage.\\nThe government announced a ` 1.7 trillion stimulus aimed at easing the bottom of the pyramid through the lockdown. At 0.8% of GDP \\nthis would be modest compared to several other countries that have undertaken much larger stimuli; the US for example has approved a \\npackage which is 10% of their GDP. We hope that on the other side of the lockdown, there will be more help from the government. The \\npain that several businesses, especially smaller ones, face around their very survival and the corresponding rise in unemployment, need \\nto be addressed. While poverty in India has usually been associated with rural India, this crisis has brought to fore the plight of the urban \\npoor, who will need focused support as unemployment situation continues to worsen.\\nOn the fixed income markets side, the market rallied in the initial months of the financial year with the budget adhering to fiscal \\nconsolidation, global developments tilting towards monetary easing, accommodative RBI policy on the backdrop of slowing economic \\ngrowth and surplus systemic liquidity. \\nThe bond market remained volatile for the remaining part of the year on concerns about the prospects of fiscal slippage due to tax cut \\nannouncement and on the prospects of additional fiscal stimulus measures given the economic slowdown. With hike in the near-term CPI, \\nRBI kept the policy action on hold post the October 2019 policy and resorted to unconventional actions to ensure that term premiums \\nreduce. These measures were intended to bring down sovereign rates and thereby enable better transmission in the corporate markets \\nover time. \\nLiquidity conditions remained in surplus all through the second half of the financial year, with the effective overnight rates trading \\nsubstantially below the policy rate in all the secured overnight funding markets. The onset of market volatility post the large scale spread \\nof the Covid-19 pandemic across the globe rattled domestic debt markets as large scale FPI outflows were witnessed. \\nThe RBI advanced its scheduled April review and announced an out of schedule policy Repo rate cut by 75bps to 4.40%. Simultaneously \\nCRR was cut by 100 bps along with a Targeted LTRO(Long Term Repo Operations) of ` 1 trillion specifically for purchase of corporate bonds \\nin primary and secondary markets. These extraordinary measures announced at the end of March 2020 had the impact of unwinding the \\nstressed levels witnessed during the preceding few weeks with rates across the curve retracing substantially. While fiscal pressures would \\nmagnify in the current context with the shutdown, RBI direct and indirect accommodation of the same becomes an inevitable option at \\nsome point.\\nThe year was:\\nMarked by regular inflows of assets, the Indian Mutual Fund Industry witnessed a reasonable growth of approximately 10%* in terms \\nof Quarterly AAUM (Average Assets Under Management). The Quarterly AAUM for the industry reached ` 27,02,511 Crores* (March 31, \\n2020) from ` 24,48,121 Crores* (March 31, 2019).

Led by regular investor education initiatives by AMFI/SEBI and industry players, the objective to move savers to investing is gaining \\nmomentum. Our focus on investor education initiatives this year was to educate potential investors and savers, including in B30 locations, \\non how mutual funds can act as solutions for their financial goals. We used different communication, advertising and thought-leadership \\nplatforms to engage with them. We continue to believe; this is the way ahead for the industry as we see different customer niches and \\nneeds emerge.\\nThe major investor awareness activities undertaken by us during the year are mentioned as under:\\n1. Development and Dissemination of Investor Education material \\na. Articles – This year we partnered with the India Today Group for a series of investor education articles on different areas of \\npersonal finance, investing and mutual funds. A separate section has been created in the English & Hindi editions of their \\nIndia Today magazine called ‘Nivesh Yatra – The Journey towards Financial Freedom’ for this initiative which publishes articles \\nfor their readers. In addition, we developed brochures from in-house content like ‘Planning for Retirement’ and ’14 Reasons \\nto fall in love with Mutual Funds’ to promote the effectiveness of mutual funds as an investment solution. The content when \\nrequired, is adapted to formats like online mailers/WhatsApp and is circulated to investors and distribution partners alike and \\nhosted on our website blog - Inspire.  /nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED10\\nb. Videos – We worked with content partners to develop videos on hybrid funds and benefits of staying invested. The video \\ntitled ‘Bumpy Ride’ highlights the benefits of staying invested despite ups and downs in market conditions while the second \\nvideo titled “H itesh Ritesh” shows the investment journey of two friends where one chooses to stay invested during volatile \\nmarkets and reaches his financial goals, while the other friend chooses to opt out during tough market conditions. Their \\njourney is beautifully showcased lyrically. We also developed a light-hearted video on Children’s Day with two child artists who \\nare curious to know about things in their surroundings. The message that we wanted to convey was as an investor you must \\nhave many queries about your investments and mutual funds could be an answer for the same. All videos were promoted \\nthrough our social media channels.\\n2. Social Media – Our objective\\xa0on social media\\xa0is to drive more engagement on our\\xa0official social handles by using an approach of \\nunique content, rich formats, and engaging representation.\\xa0Following this approach, we have run quite a few quiz\\xa0series under \\nthe name #SBIMFQuizTime on\\xa0Twitter with an intention to engage with our existing and potential followers\\xa0on different aspects \\nof mutual funds and financial planning.\\xa0We also did some topical content on festivals and occasion such as:\\n a. New Year-\\xa0Get fiscally fit (promoted SIP, ELSS & SWP)\\n b. Valentine’s Day -\\xa014 Reasons to fall in love with Mutual Funds\\n c. Women’s Day -\\xa0Creatives targeting a Homemaker, Working women and Women entrepreneur\\n Other than this we continue to reach out to audiences with various posts on SIP, Equity Investing through Mutual Funds, Fixed \\nMaturity Plans, Use of Systematic Withdrawal Plans for regular\\xa0cash flow\\xa0for expenses and more. Our community on social media \\nplatforms like Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter has crossed over seven lakh followers\\xa0and continues to grow. \\xa0\\xa0\\n3. Online\\xa0Marketing\\xa0–\\xa0We continue to focus on reaching out to millennials who are increasingly preferring a digital experience over \\nthe traditional. One of our investor awareness initiatives of the year was\\xa0#WhatsYourExcuse, aimed at those\\xa0audiences who keep \\ndelaying their investments\\xa0due to various reasons. Concepts like\\xa0online\\xa0investing and\\xa0possibility to register\\xa0SIP\\xa0even when on \\na\\xa0holiday\\xa0online/via an app were specifically made for them.\\xa0\\xa0In addition, we continuously promote concepts\\xa0like SIP,\\xa0Goal-based \\ninvesting through mutual funds\\xa0and ELSS (ELSS means LESS tax) through\\xa0prominent\\xa0domain and finance\\xa0sites like Café Mutual, \\nMorningstar India, Value Research and distribution-led sites like AdvisorKhoj. These activities are supplemented with\\xa0organic and \\naffiliate\\xa0email campaigns which\\xa0help in reach and awareness to a large group of online audiences.\\n4. Public Relations/Media – With the evolving media consumption habits, interaction across social media, print publications, and \\nonline media remains important. We continue to reach out to key media including regional (Newspapers, Magazines, Online and \\nTelevision) to establish thought leadership by getting relevant coverage in large format industry stories, authored articles and Q&A’s \\nwith spokespersons covering business, funds and investment and investor awareness aspects. We also continued to have a sustained \\nfocus on reaching out to potential investors through regional media sharing concepts for investor awareness like our ‘Nivesh Ke \\nNuske’ section in magazines like ‘Nivesh Manthan’\\xa0and highlighting the benefits of mutual funds, financial planning and other \\naspects of personal finance.\\xa0 \\xa0\\n5. Television & On-ground Events – Our association with CNBC Awaaz, a leading Hindi business channel from the CNBC-TV18 network, \\nfor Pehla Kadam – Season 5, a holistic investor education initiative across India, continued this year with an exclusive tie-up to \\npromote mutual funds as an investment option for financial goals. This included a mix of on-ground events, in-studio discussions, \\ncorporate campus events and online/social media. As part of the sponsorship, we plan to have 15 episodes (10 in-studio discussions \\nand 5 episodes compiled from on-ground events) on different facets of financial planning and mutual funds. The on-ground events \\nwill include corporate campus and public auditorium events to engage with first-time investors, homemakers, youth, retail investors, \\nentrepreneur community and retirees. The initiative is also promoted extensively via social media and promos on TV18 channels.\\n6. Media Campaigns – We had a couple of opportunities in the past year to use tactical media campaigns to promote mutual funds \\namongst the masses with the theme/message viral at that point of time.\\na) Cricket World Cup is an important property from an advertising standpoint, as it is once in 4 years, where a lot of ‘eyeballs’ are \\navailable across media. It was an opportune time for us to use this highly viewed event as a tactical opportunity to promote \\nmutual funds amongst the masses and correlate the similarities in Cricket with Mutual Funds. Our investor education campaign, \\n‘Khelo Financial Growth Ka Innings’ , during the World Cup brought out the similarities in scenarios between mutual funds \\nand cricket with advertisements like e.g. Singles can also help win a match (similar to using SIPs to build a corpus) and Long-\\nInnings and Long-term investing both don’t deserve a run out. This was promoted in online media (our website, third-party \\nadvertising and social media) and in select business/personal finance publications like MINT, Business Standard, Financial \\nExpress, Hindu Business Line and ET Wealth./nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED11\\nb) Our next tactical campaign of the year was inspired from the Prime Minister’s Independence Day speech where he laid out \\na vision for India to become a $5 Trillion economy. Our message focused on the fact the policy reforms being put in place \\nby the Government for different sectors will enable them to grow. Thus, an allocation through equity funds can enable an \\ninvestor to build long-term wealth and our message ‘Participate in the journey towards a $5 Trillion economy with Equity \\nFunds’  was to reinforce that equity as an asset class through mutual funds is a convenient option to participate. The campaign \\nwas extensively promoted across outdoor (40 cities), online media (our website, third-party advertising and social media) and \\nprint media (English and 8 Regional language publications - Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Tamil, Kannada, Telegu and \\nPunjabi).\\nc) Equity Linked Saving Schemes (ELSS) continue to be an ideal investment option for those looking to build long-term wealth \\nwhile availing tax benefit on their investments. ‘ELSS means LESS tax’ was our message to investors so the tax-saving message \\nclearly stood out to investors. The message explained in detail in the magazine advertisements how investments in ELSS can \\nhelp save tax while elaborating on the benefits on investing in equity-linked schemes like ELSS to build wealth while getting \\ntax benefit on investments of up to `. 1.5 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The message was promoted through \\nbelow-the-line collaterals like banners, standees as well as in online/social media to increase the reach of the message.\\nd) The last quarter of FY 19-20 saw a lot of market movement, firstly with the downturn in the economy and later with the \\ncoronavirus situation limiting activity worldwide, with fall across large, mid and small cap companies. At such a time, we \\nthought to remind investors that such ‘black swan events’ are opportune times to stay invested as long-term goals should not \\nget affected by these bumps in the road. Our message ‘Don’t take a U-turn on your investments’ was to drive that point across \\nand we exclusively used online media (emailers and social media posts) to promote the same as other media were affected \\ndue to the lockdown in force across the country, while the entire audience was online tracking news and other information.\\n7. The AMC conducted 297 Investor Education meets with 17,487 participants in FY 19-20. In these events, trained professionals \\ndiscussed the importance of savings, financial goals, benefit of compounding in wealth creation, healthy wealthy habits amongst \\nother personal finance topics. Investment awareness videos were screened at these programs with trainers available to explain, \\nclarify or answer various queries. Booklets/Collaterals in regional languages on investor awareness were also distributed in these \\nprograms. We also did an investor awareness program at a Chartered Accountants Conference for nearly 3,200 participants. Our \\ninvestor awareness programs are conducted at State Bank of India Branches, Army Cantonments, CRPF, Air Force stations, Educational \\nInstitutes, Municipal Schools and at Corporate offices of Companies. These events continue to be well received by the investing/\\ngeneral public and are key to spreading financial literacy and awareness across the country.\\nNEW INITIATIVES  \\n1. In FY 2020, SBIFM was certified as a ‘Great Place To Work’ for the period March 2020 to Feb 2021. This is a result of High-Trust and \\nHigh-Performance Culture in the organisation. \\n2. On the digital front, 85% of all lumpsum purchase transactions and 75% of all SIP transactions were registered digitally. Despite \\ndiscontinuation of Aadhaar based on-boarding, last year over 10.85 lacs, i.e. 61% of new investors of SBI Mutual Fund were added \\ndigitally. We also launched voice assistants on Alexa and Google Home devices. We have also created ‘smart statement’ of accounts \\nwhich redefines online statement of accounts by including several insights on one’s investments.\\xa0 Further, we introduced the \\nWhatsApp Chatbot in March 2020, which already has over 14,000 registered users.\\n3. Our focus continued to be on the B30 locations as our endeavour is to grow organically through higher penetration in these \\ngeographies. To further boost our efforts in B30 locations, we have launched 14 new Branches in the year taking the total number \\nof Branches to 222 including 176 in B30 locations.\\n4. We have also gained a fair share of the industry SIP book as SIP is one of the strongest investment tools available to investors and it \\nalso adds to regular and sustainable long term inflows in core assets. In March 2020, our SIP book stood at  `1,180 crores as compared \\nto  ` 1,056 crores as of March 2019. \\n5. With a view to build a sustainable business for all the stakeholders and putting investors safety first, we continuously work towards  \\nenhancing our risk mitigation processes and the same has proven to be effective in FY 2020. \\n6. In FY 2020, SBIFM became the first AMC in the country to be fully compliant with the Global Investment Performance Standards( \\nGIPS), administered by the CFA Institute. GIPS is a global guide for the principles that investment companies need to follow while \\ncalculating and presenting performance data to clients. This adds another layer of credibility to our business functioning through \\na fair representation of the performance to our customers /nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED12\\n7. With the focus on customer service, SBIFM continues to invest significantly in this segment to help investors throughout their \\ninvestment journey. We have addressed many customer pain points by gathering customer feedback, process improvements, system \\nenhancements, strengthened governance around repeated queries and upskilling of teams along with speedy resolution. We have \\nmade continuous improvement in On-boarding and Investment processes by providing enhanced digital solutions both for our \\ninvestors and distributors. Overall complaints continue to trend downwards. \\n8. We have substantially grown our PMS institutional book by On-boarding some of the most esteemed and the largest PF (Provident \\nFund) organisations. \\n9. From customer’s perspective, SBI Mutual Fund continues to believe in offering investment solutions rather than a product-selling \\napproach.\\xa0 Accordingly, we launched services such as SWP – A, SIP Top up cap, SIP Pause etc. during the year. \\nVII. CHANGE IN NATURE OF BUSINESS \\nThere was no change in the nature of business during the year under review.\\nVIII. MATERIAL CHANGES AND COMMITMENTS, IF ANY AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE COMPANY \\nWHICH HAVE OCCURED IN BETWEEN THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR OF THE COMPANY TO WHICH THE FINANCIAL \\nSTATEMENTS RELATE AND THE DATE OF THE REPORT\\nThere have been no material changes and commitments affecting the financial position of the Company which have occurred between \\nthe end of the financial year 2019-20 and the date of this report.\\nIX. FUTURE PLANS\\n1. FY 20-21 has begun amidst COVID-19 - a completely unprecedented situation. Everyone in the industry and across the globe has \\nbeen affected by it. While everyone is trying innovative ways to ensure business continuity, the real challenge will be the new world \\nthat we will be a part of once this is over and we enter a new normal. \\n2. From the business perspective, we expect FY 20-21 to be a challenging year for the entire industry, both from the perspective of \\ngrowth in assets as well as pressure on margins. We will accordingly focus on cost optimization through forward and backward \\nintegration. However, we will continue to invest in the core needs of business enhancement. We will also make significant investments \\ninto technology to protect our data and develop highest standards of data security.\\n3. On the digital front, we will continue to work on making the customer journey more personalised and effective in better investment \\nplanning. We will work on a data platform project which will help in various analytics use-cases for business impact.\\xa0\\n4. In terms of our product basket, we will continue to add funds, both from the point of view of introducing innovative products and \\naddressing product gaps. We will have products across solution-oriented and debt categories. We will also continue to expand our \\npassive offerings. We will also focus on creating tools and solutions which will help investors in achieving their investment goals.\\n5. We will continue to develop newer business segments of PMS and AIF by launching differentiated strategies under these vehicles.\\nX. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILTY (CSR)\\nThe objective of the CSR policy adopted by the Company is working towards social welfare and strengthening its bond with community. \\nIts emphasis is on assisting groups belonging to the weaker and downtrodden sections of society by providing avenues for improvement \\nof their economic condition.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the \\nStandalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued \\nby the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the independence requirements that are relevant to our audit \\nof the Standalone Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical \\nresponsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained \\nis sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements.\\nInformation Other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon\\nThe Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of other information. The other information comprises the information \\nincluded in the Director’s Report but does not include the Standalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Director’s \\nreport is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report. \\nOur opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance \\nconclusion thereon. \\nIn connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above \\nwhen it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone Financial \\nStatements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\\nManagement’s Responsibility for the Standalone Financial Statements\\nThe Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of \\nthese standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, total comprehensive \\nincome, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted \\nin India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for \\nsafeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application \\nof appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and \\nmaintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the \\naccounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view \\nand are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.STANDALONE/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED29\\nIn preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going \\nconcern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management \\neither intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\\nThe Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.\\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from material \\nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high \\nlevel of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement \\nwhen it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could \\nreasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the \\naudit. We also:\\n•\\t Identify\\t and\\tassess\\tthe\\trisks\\tof\\tmaterial\\t misstatement\\t of\\tthe\\tStandalone\\t Financial\\t Statements,\\t whether\\t due\\tto\\tfraud\\tor\\terror,\\tdesign\\t\\nand perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a \\nbasis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from \\nerror, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\\n•\\t Obtain\\t an\\tunderstanding\\t of\\tinternal\\t financial\\t control\\trelevant\\t to\\tthe\\taudit\\tin\\torder\\tto\\tdesign\\taudit\\tprocedures\\t that\\tare\\tappropriate\\t\\nin the circumstances. Under section 143(3) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has \\nadequate internal financial controls with reference to the Standalone Financial Statements, in place and the operating effectiveness \\nof such controls;\\n•\\t Evaluate\\t the\\tappropriateness\\t of\\taccounting\\t policies\\tused\\tand\\tthe\\treasonableness\\t of\\taccounting\\t estimates\\t and\\trelated\\tdisclosures\\t\\nmade by Management;\\n•\\t Conclude\\t on\\tthe\\tappropriateness\\t of\\tmanagement’s\\t use\\tof\\tthe\\tgoing\\tconcern\\t basis\\tof\\taccounting\\t and,\\tbased\\ton\\tthe\\taudit\\tevidence\\t\\nobtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s \\nability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our \\nauditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify \\nour opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future \\nevents or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern;\\n•\\t Evaluate\\t the\\toverall\\tpresentation,\\t structure\\t and\\tcontent\\t of\\tthe\\tStandalone\\t Financial\\t Statements,\\t including\\t the\\tdisclosures,\\t and\\t\\nwhether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair \\npresentation;\\nMateriality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable \\nthat the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the standalone financial statements may be influenced. We consider \\nquantitative materiality and qualitative factors in:\\n(i) Planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and \\n(ii) To evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the standalone financial statements.\\nWe communicate with the Management, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, \\nincluding any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit;\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding \\nindependence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our \\nindependence, and where applicable, related safeguards.STANDALONE/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED30\\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\\n1.

On investments in certain mutual funds, the company is \\nentitled to a daily / weekly dividend. This dividend is accounted for at such frequency as the right to receive \\npayment is established.\\n(b)  Interest income:\\n Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to \\nthe Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by \\nreference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate (EIR) applicable, which is the rate that \\nexactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net \\ncarrying amount on initial recognition. Interest income is included in finance income in the statement of profit \\nand loss. In case of staff loans interest income is recognised on accrual basis.\\n1.7  Scheme Expenses \\n(a)  Recurring expenses of schemes borne by the Company are recognised under respective expense heads in the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss unless considered recoverable from the schemes in accordance with provisions of SEBI (Mutual Fund) \\nRegulations 1996 and circular issued from time to time.\\n Expenses of schemes of SBI Mutual Fund, in excess of the stipulated rates, are required to be borne by the Company in \\naccordance with the requirements of SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, and as such, are charged to the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss.\\n(b)  Brokerage: Brokerage and/or Incentive paid on investments in open-ended Equity Linked Tax Saving Schemes and \\nSystematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are amortized over a period of 36 months and in case of other schemes, over the claw \\nback period from beginning of the month brokerage is paid.

A contract is, or contains, a lease if \\nthe contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. \\nTo assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) \\nthe contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use \\nof the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. At the date of \\ncommencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all \\nlease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low \\nvalue leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense \\non a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \\n Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU \\nassets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. The right-of-use \\nassets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments \\nmade at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are \\nsubsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from \\nthe commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED45\\nRight of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying \\namounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair \\nvalue less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash \\nflows that are largely independent of those from other assets. \\n The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments \\nare discounted using the interest rate. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of \\nuse asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. Lease liability \\nand ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash \\nflows. \\n1.9 Foreign currencies\\n(a)  Functional and presentation currency\\n Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of primary economic environment in which \\nthe company operates (‘the Functional currency’). The functional currency of the company is determined to be Indian \\nrupee (INR). The financial statements are presented in Indian rupee and rounded off to the nearest lakhs except shares \\nand per share data.\\n(b)  Foreign Currency Transactions and translations\\n Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using respective currency exchange rates prevailing \\non the date of transaction first qualify for recognition.\\ni. Monetary items:\\n Foreign exchange gains or losses realized up on settlement of transactions or translation of monetary assets \\nand liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in profit and loss account using reporting date \\nexchange rates.\\nii. Non-monetary items : \\n Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the \\nexchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. \\n Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into functional currency \\nat the exchange rate when fair value is determined. \\n The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the \\nrecognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose \\nfair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).\\n1.10  Employee benefits  \\n(a)  Defined Contribution Plan :\\n- Provident Fund  \\n The Company has defined contribution plans for post-employment benefits in the form of Provident fund. Under \\nthe Provident Fund plan, the company contributes to Government administered Provident Fund on behalf of \\nemployees. The Company has no further obligation beyond making the contribution. \\n The Company’s contribution to Government Provident Fund is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n- Superannuation  \\n Superannuation fund is a defined contribution scheme.

The Company recognizes such contribution as an expense as and when incurred.\\n- National Pension Scheme\\n National Pension Scheme is a defined contribution scheme. In case employee opts for National Pension Scheme, \\nthe Company contributes a sum not exceeding 10% of basic salary plus dearness pay of the eligible employees’ \\nsalary to the National Pension Scheme. The Company recognizes such contribution as an expense as and when \\nincurred.\\n(b)  Defined Benefit Plan:  Gratuity  \\n Gratuity liability is a defined benefit obligation and is funded through a Gratuity Fund administered by trustees \\nand managed by the Life Insurance Corporation of India. The Company accounts for liability for future gratuity \\nbenefits based on the actuarial valuation using Projected Unit Credit Method carried out as at the end of each \\nfinancial year. Actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognized in the Statement of Profit and loss. \\n Gratuity liabilities are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an independent actuary, at each reporting \\ndate using the projected unit credit method. The Company recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit \\nplan in its balance sheet as an asset or liability, as the case may be. The discount rate is based on the government \\nsecurities yield. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions \\nare recorded in other comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which \\nthey arise.\\n(c)  Other Long-term employee benefit obligation : Compensated absences\\n The company provides for the encashment of leave or leave with pay subject to certain rules. The employees are \\nentitled to accumulate leave subject to certain limits, for future encashment. The liability is provided based on the \\nnumber of days of unutilized leave at each balance sheet date on the basis of an independent actuarial valuation \\ncarried out as at the end of each financial year. \\n(d)  Employee Share Based Payments:\\n Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair \\nvalue of the equity instruments at the grant date.\\n The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on amortised \\nbasis over the vesting period, based on the Company\\'s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, \\nwith a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of \\nthe number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is \\nrecognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding \\nadjustment to the equity-settled employee benefits reserve.\\n1.11  Income taxes\\n Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year. \\nCurrent and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised \\nin other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other \\ncomprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\\n(a) Current tax\\n Current income tax for current and prior period is recognised at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid \\nto the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted at the \\nreporting date.\\n Current income taxes are recognised in the statement of profit and loss except for items those are recognised outside \\nprofit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity), related tax for such items are recognised either in \\nOther Comprehensive income or in Equity.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED47\\n Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax \\npaid and income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying units intends to \\nsettle the asset and liability on a net basis. \\n(b) Deferred tax\\n Deferred income tax is recognized using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are \\nmeasured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, \\nbased on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. \\n The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent \\nthat it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset \\nto be recovered. \\n Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences except for investment in subsidiaries \\nand associates, when the timings of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that \\nthe temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. \\n1.12  Property, plant and equipment\\n(a)  Recognition and measurement\\n All items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment \\nlosses, if any. Historical cost includes expenses directly attributable to the acquisition of an asset.\\n Advances paid towards the acquisition of property and equipment and the cost of property and equipment not ready \\nfor use before the reporting date are disclosed separately in the property and equipment schedule.\\n Improvements to leasehold premises are amortised over the primary lease period subject to a maximum period of five \\nyears.\\n(b) Depreciation\\n Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognised using Straight Line Method (SLM) to expense the cost less \\nresidual values over estimated useful lives as prescribed under Schedule II of Companies Act, 2013. Estimated useful \\nlives of property, plant and equipment as stipulated under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 and adopted by \\nmanagement for various block of assets in as under:\\nAssets Useful life (in years)\\nOffice Premises 60\\nComputers- Servers and networks 6\\nComputers- End user devices, such as, desktops, laptops, etc. 3\\nFurniture and fixtures 10\\nOffice Equipment (including Electrical Installation & Building Management systems) 5\\nGlow Sign Board 2\\nVehicles 8\\n Depreciation on assets purchased or sold during the year is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a pro-rata \\nbasis from the date of addition or as the case may be, up to the date on which the asset is sold.\\n All fixed assets individually costing less than ` 5,000 are fully depreciated in the year of purchase/acquisition.\\n Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each financial year and changes, if any, are \\naccounted prospectively. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED48\\n1.13  Intangible assets\\n(a)  Recognition and measurement\\n Intangible assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortization \\nand accumulated impairment loss, if any.\\n Initial cost of software implementation is capitalised and any subsequent maintenance cost or enhancement cost \\nare expensed out to statement of profit and loss unless it meets recognition criteria. \\n Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation \\nand accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated \\nuseful lives in the statement of profit and loss. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at \\nthe end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective \\nbasis. \\n(b)  Useful lives of intangible assets\\n Estimated useful lives of the intangible assets adopted by management are as follows:\\nDescription of assets Useful lives \\n (In years)Method of depreciation / \\namortization \\nComputer software 3 - 6 years SLM\\nWebsite development cost 3 years SLM\\nCopyright licenses 5 years SLM\\n1.14  De-recognition of PPE and Intangible Assets\\n Carrying amount (net of accumulated depreciation and amortisation) of property, plant and equipment and intangible \\nasset is derecognised upon its disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued \\nuse of the asset.\\n Any gains or losses arising on such disposal is determined based on difference between net proceeds and carrying \\namount and such gains or losses are recognised in statement of profit and loss. \\n1.15  Provisions, Contingent liability and contingent asset \\n Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past events, \\nit is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and \\na reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\\n The expenses relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement.\\n Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the \\npresent obligation at the end of reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is pre-tax rate \\nthat reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specified to the liability. The increase \\nin provision due to passage of time is recognised as finance cost. \\n When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third \\nparty, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount \\nof the receivable can be measured reliably.\\n Contingent liabilities\\n A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the \\noccurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present \\nobligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the \\nobligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognised \\nbecause it cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. The Company does not recognize a contingent liability but NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED49\\ndiscloses its existence in the financial statements unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is considered \\nremote.\\n Contingent Liabilities in respect of show cause notices are considered only when converted into demands.\\n Loss contingencies arising from claims, litigation, assessment, fines, penalties, etc. are recorded when it is probable that \\na liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\\n1.16  Financial instruments  \\n Financial instruments\\n Initial recognition\\n The Company recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions \\nof the instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade \\nreceivables which are initially measured at transaction price. \\n Subsequent measurement\\n Financial assets carried at amortised cost\\n A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to \\nhold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on \\nspecified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\\n Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\\n A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is held within a \\nbusiness model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the \\ncontractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal \\nand interest on the principal amount outstanding.\\n The Company has made an irrevocable election for its investments which are classified as equity instruments to present \\nthe subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income based on its business model. Further, in cases where \\nthe Company has made an irrevocable election based on its business model, for its investments which are classified as \\nequity instruments, the subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income.\\n Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\\n A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are subsequently fair valued through profit or \\nloss.\\n Derecognition of Financial assets\\n The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or when \\nit transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party\\n Impairment of financial assets\\n In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of \\nfinancial assets other than those measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL). \\n Expected credit losses are measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:\\n•\\t The\\t 12-months\\t expected\\t credit\\tlosses\\t(expected\\t credit\\tlosses\\tthat\\tresult\\tfrom\\tthose\\tdefault\\tevents\\ton\\tthe\\tfinancial\\t\\ninstrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date); or \\n•\\t Full\\t lifetime\\t expected\\t credit\\tlosses\\t(expected\\t credit\\tlosses\\tthat\\tresult\\tfrom\\tall\\tpossible\\t default\\tevents\\tover\\tthe\\tlife\\t\\nof the financial instrument) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED50\\n For trade receivables Company applies ‘simplified approach’ which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised \\nfrom initial recognition of the receivables. The Company uses historical default rates to determine impairment loss on \\nthe portfolio of trade receivables. At every reporting date, these historical default rates are reviewed and changes in \\nthe forward-looking estimates are analysed. \\n For other assets, the Company uses 12-month ECL to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase \\nin credit risk. If there is significant increase in credit risk full lifetime ECL is used.\\n Financial liabilities\\n Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost. For trade and other payables maturing within one year \\nfrom the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\\n Derecognition of financial liabilities\\n The Company derecognises financial liabilities when the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have \\nexpired. \\n Equity instruments :\\n All equity investments in scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading \\nare classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company decides to classify the same either as at FVTOCI \\nor FVTPL. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by instrument basis. The classification is made on initial \\nrecognition and is irrevocable. If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value \\nchanges on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from \\nOCI to Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative \\ngain or loss within equity.\\n Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss.\\n1.17  Earnings per share\\n The basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity \\nshares outstanding during the year.\\n Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue equity \\nshares were exercised or converted during the period/year. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted \\naverage number of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding at the year end.\\n1.18  Dividends\\n Final dividends on shares are recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the shareholders and interim dividends \\nare recorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the company’s Board of Directors.\\n1.19  Standards Issued but not Effective\\n There is no such notification issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) which would have been applicable \\nfrom April 1, 2020.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED51\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n(` in Lakhs)\\n2.

The fund has the form of a trust and it is \\ngoverned by the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition \\nof the Investment strategy .   \\nRisks associated with defined benefit plan    \\nGratuity is a defined benefit plan and company is exposed to the Following Risks:    \\nInterest rate risk:  A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the G.Sec Rate will Increase the present value of the liability requiring \\nhigher provision. A fall in the discount rate generally increase the mark to market value of the assets depending on the duration of \\nasset.    \\nSalary Risk:  The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of members As such an \\nincrease in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.    \\nInvestment Risk:  The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by \\nreference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will \\ncreate a plan deficit. Currently, for the plan in India it has a relatively balanced mix of investments in government securities, and other \\ndebt instruments.    \\nAsset Liability Matching Risk:  The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow Since the plan is invested in lines of Rule 101 of \\nIncome Tax Rules, 1962. this generally reduces ALM risk.    \\nMortality risk:  Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan do not have any \\nlongevity risk    \\nConcentration Risk:  Plan is having a concentration risk all the assets are invested in the insurance company and a default will wipe out \\nall the assets. Although probability of this is very less as Insurance companies have to follow regulatory guidelines.   \\nGratuity is taken care by separate trust fund and contribution is guided by Rule 103 of Income Tax Rules 1962.   \\nThe principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows.\\nParticulars Valuation as at\\n31 Mar 2020 31 Mar 2019\\nDiscount rate(s) 6.89% 7.79%\\nExpected rate(s) of salary increase 5% p.a 5% p.aNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED66\\nAmounts recognised in the statement of profit and loss in respect of these defined benefit plans are as follows. \\n(` In Lakh)\\nParticulars Year ended  \\n31 Mar 2020Year ended  \\n31 Mar 2019\\nService cost:\\n Current service cost  151.44  110.02 \\n Past service cost and (gain)/loss from settlements  -

Liquidity Risk \\nLiquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The company maintains sufficient \\nbank balance and marketable securities such as liquid/ultra-short duration and other debt funds.\\n2. Credit Risk \\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing financial \\nloss to the company. The company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business \\nactivities. The company has well defined investment policy restricting investments in various risk categories such high/moderate high/\\nmoderate etc.\\n3. Foreign currency risk management:    \\nThe company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. \\nExchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.\\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the \\nreporting period are as follows.     \\n(` in Lakhs)\\nCurrency Liabilities Assets\\nAs at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019As at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019\\nAED - 7.73 13.23\\nUSD 18.81 44.44 866.81 622.97\\nBHD 22.95 10.28                    -                     -   \\nAUD -                       -   3.52 2.67\\nJPY                   -                         -   76.98 82.73\\nSGD                   -                         -   127.29 151.66\\n \\nForeign currency sensitivity analysis:    \\nThe following table details the Company’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the Rupee against the relevant foreign \\ncurrencies. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents \\nmanagement’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding \\nforeign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency \\nrates. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or equity where the Rupee strengthens 10% against the relevant currency. \\nFor a 10% weakening of the Rupee against the relevant currency, there would be a comparable impact on the profit or equity, and the \\nbalances below would be negative.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued \\nby the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the independence requirements that are relevant to our audit \\nof the consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other \\nethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have \\nobtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\\nInformation Other than the Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon\\nThe Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of other information. The other information comprises the information \\nincluded in the Director’s Report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Director’s \\nreport is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report. \\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance \\nconclusion thereon. \\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above \\nwhen it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated \\nfinancial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. \\nManagement’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nThe Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation \\nof these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial \\nperformance, consolidated total comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Company \\nin accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. The respective Board of Directors of the \\ncompanies included in the Group,  and its associates are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with \\nthe provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; \\nselection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, \\nimplementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and \\ncompleteness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give /nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED81\\nCONSOLIDATEDa true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error , which have been used for the purpose of \\npreparation of these Consolidated  Financial Statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.\\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going \\nconcern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management \\neither intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\\nThose respective Board of Directors included in the group are also responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material \\nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high \\nlevel of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when \\nit exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably \\nbe expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the \\naudit. We also:\\nl Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design \\nand perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a \\nbasis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from \\nerror, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; \\nl Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate \\nin the circumstances. Under section 143(3) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding \\nCompany, its subsidiary companies and its associate companies which are incorporated in India has adequate internal financial \\ncontrols with reference to the consolidated financial statements, in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls;\\nl Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures \\nmade by management;\\nl Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence \\nobtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s \\nability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our \\nauditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify \\nour opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future \\nevents or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\\nl Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and \\nwhether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair \\npresentation;\\nl Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group \\nto express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance \\nof the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements.\\nMateriality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it \\nprobable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial statements may be influenced. We consider \\nquantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and \\n(ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the financial statements.\\nWe communicate with the Management, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, \\nincluding any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding \\nindependence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our \\nindependence, and where applicable, related safeguards./nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED82\\nCONSOLIDATEDOther Matter\\nWe did not audit the financial statements of foreign subsidiary whose financial statements reflect total assets of Rs. 318.05 Lakh as at \\n31st March 2020, total revenues of Rs. 426.32 Lakh and net cash outflows amounting to Rs.0.36 Lakh for the year ended on that date, as \\nconsidered in the consolidated financial statements.

These estimates, judgements and \\nassumptions affect application of accounting policies and the reported amount of assets, liabilities, disclosure of contingent \\nassets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amount of income and expenses for the periods \\npresented.\\n In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting \\npolicies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements are as below:\\n• Financial instruments\\n• Property, plant and equipment\\n• Intangible assets\\n• Obligation relating to employee benefits \\n• Provisions and contingencies\\n• Provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.\\n• Scheme expenses\\n1.5  Revenue recognition\\n1.5.1  Revenue from Operations\\n The company recognises revenue when amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that future \\neconomic benefits will flow to the company, regardless of when payment is being made.\\n Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually \\ndefined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government. \\n The following is the description of the activities of the business from which the Company generates its revenue:\\n(a) Management Fees:\\n Management fee is recognized at specific rates agreed with the relevant schemes in terms of scheme document, \\napplied on the average daily net assets of each scheme (excluding inter-scheme investments, wherever applicable, \\ninvestments made by the Company in the respective scheme and deposits with Banks), and are in conformity with \\nthe limits specified under SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. Management fees on AIF schemes are recognized \\nat specific rates agreed with relevant schemes in terms of offer document, applied on daily average asset of each \\nschemes.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED95\\nCONSOLIDATED(b) Portfolio Advisory services and Portfolio Management services: \\n Portfolio advisory services and Portfolio Management services income is recognized as per the contractual \\narrangement.\\n1.5.2  Other Income:\\n(a) Dividend income:\\n Dividend income from investments is recognised when the right to receive payment has been established, which \\nis generally when shareholders approve the dividend. On investments in certain mutual funds, the company is \\nentitled to a daily / weekly dividend. This dividend is accounted for at such frequency as the right to receive \\npayment is established.\\n(b)  Interest income:\\n Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to \\nthe Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by \\nreference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate (EIR) applicable, which is the rate that \\nexactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net \\ncarrying amount on initial recognition. Interest income is included in finance income in the statement of profit \\nand loss. In case of staff loans interest income is recognised on accrual basis.\\n1.6  Scheme Expenses \\n(a)  Recurring expenses of schemes borne by the Company are recognised under respective expense heads in the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss unless considered recoverable from the schemes in accordance with provisions of SEBI (Mutual Fund) \\nRegulations 1996 and circular issued from time to time.\\n Expenses of schemes of SBI Mutual Fund, in excess of the stipulated rates, are required to be borne by the Company in \\naccordance with the requirements of SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, and as such, are charged to the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss.\\n(b)  Brokerage: Brokerage and/or Incentive paid on investments in open-ended Equity Linked Tax Saving Schemes and \\nSystematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are amortized over a period of 36 months and in case of other schemes, over the claw \\nback period from beginning of the month brokerage is paid. In case of Close ended schemes, brokerage is amortized \\nover the tenure of schemes.\\n(c)  New Fund Offer Expenses: Expenses relating to new fund offer of SBI Mutual Fund are charged to the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss in the year in which they are incurred in accordance with the requirements of SEBI (Mutual Fund) \\nRegulations, 1996.\\n1.7  Leases\\n The Company as a lessee The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for office on lease and other assets . \\nThe Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if \\nthe contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. \\nTo assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) \\nthe contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use \\nof the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. At the date of \\ncommencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all \\nlease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low \\nvalue leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense \\non a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \\n Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU \\nassets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. The right-of-use NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED96\\nCONSOLIDATEDassets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments \\nmade at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are \\nsubsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from \\nthe commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. \\nRight of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying \\namounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair \\nvalue less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash \\nflows that are largely independent of those from other assets. \\n The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments \\nare discounted using the interest rate. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of \\nuse asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. Lease liability \\nand ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash \\nflows. \\n1.8  Foreign currencies\\n(a)  Functional and presentation currency\\n Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of primary economic environment in which \\nthe company operates (‘the Functional currency’). The functional currency of the company is determined to be Indian \\nrupee (INR). The financial statements are presented in Indian rupee and rounded off to the nearest lakhs except shares \\nand per share data.\\n(b)  Foreign Currency Transactions and translations\\n Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using respective currency exchange rates prevailing \\non the date of transaction first qualify for recognition.\\ni. Monetary items:\\n Foreign exchange gains or losses realized up on settlement of transactions or translation of monetary assets \\nand liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in profit and loss account using reporting date \\nexchange rates.\\nii.  Non-monetary items : \\n Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the \\nexchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. \\n Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into functional currency \\nat the exchange rate when fair value is determined. \\n The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the \\nrecognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose \\nfair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).\\n1.9  Employee benefits  \\n(a)  Defined Contribution Plan :\\n- Provident Fund  \\n The Company has defined contribution plans for post-employment benefits in the form of Provident fund. Under \\nthe Provident Fund plan, the company contributes to Government administered Provident Fund on behalf of \\nemployees. The Company has no further obligation beyond making the contribution. \\n The Company’s contribution to Government Provident Fund is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED97\\nCONSOLIDATED- Superannuation  \\n Superannuation fund is a defined contribution scheme. In case employee opts for superannuation fund, the Company \\ncontributes a sum equivalent to 15% of basic salary plus dearness pay of the eligible managerial cadre employees’ \\nsalary to the Superannuation Fund administered by trustees and managed by the Life Insurance Corporation of \\nIndia. The Company recognizes such contribution as an expense as and when incurred.\\n- National Pension Scheme\\n National Pension Scheme is a defined contribution scheme. In case employee opts for National Pension Scheme, \\nthe Company contributes a sum not exceeding 10% of basic salary plus dearness pay of the eligible employees’ \\nsalary to the National Pension Scheme. The Company recognizes such contribution as an expense as and when \\nincurred.\\n(b)  Defined Benefit Plan:  Gratuity  \\n Gratuity liability is a defined benefit obligation and is funded through a Gratuity Fund administered by trustees and \\nmanaged by the Life Insurance Corporation of India. The Company accounts for liability for future gratuity benefits \\nbased on the actuarial valuation using Projected Unit Credit Method carried out as at the end of each financial year. \\nActuarial gains and losses are immediately recognized in the Statement of Profit and loss. \\n Gratuity liabilities are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an independent actuary, at each reporting date \\nusing the projected unit credit method. The Company recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit plan in its \\nbalance sheet as an asset or liability, as the case may be. The discount rate is based on the government securities yield. \\nActuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recorded in \\nother comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.\\n(c)  Other Long-term employee benefit obligation : Compensated absences\\n The company provides for the encashment of leave or leave with pay subject to certain rules. The employees are entitled \\nto accumulate leave subject to certain limits, for future encashment. The liability is provided based on the number of \\ndays of unutilized leave at each balance sheet date on the basis of an independent actuarial valuation carried out as \\nat the end of each financial year. \\n(d)  Employee Share Based Payments:\\n Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value \\nof the equity instruments at the grant date.\\n The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on amortised \\nbasis over the vesting period, based on the Company\\'s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a \\ncorresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number \\nof equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in \\nprofit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the \\nequity-settled employee benefits reserve.\\n1.10  Income taxes\\n Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year. \\nCurrent and deferred taxes are recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, except when they relate to items \\nthat are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also \\nrecognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\\n(a) Current tax\\n Current income tax for current and prior period is recognised at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid \\nto the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted at the \\nreporting date.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED98\\nCONSOLIDATED Current income taxes are recognised in the statement of profit and loss except for items those are recognised outside \\nprofit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity), related tax for such items are recognised either in \\nOther Comprehensive income or in Equity.\\n Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax \\npaid and income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying units intends to \\nsettle the asset and liability on a net basis. \\n(b) Deferred tax\\n Deferred income tax is recognized using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are \\nmeasured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, \\nbased on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. \\n The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent \\nthat it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset \\nto be recovered. \\n Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences except for investment in subsidiaries \\nand associates, when the timings of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that \\nthe temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  \\n The Group offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right to set off the \\nrecognized amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability \\nsimultaneously.\\n1.11  Property, plant and equipment\\n(a)  Recognition and measurement\\n All items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment \\nlosses, if any. Historical cost includes expenses directly attributable to the acquisition of an asset.\\n Advances paid towards the acquisition of property and equipment and the cost of property and equipment not ready \\nfor use before the reporting date are disclosed separately in the property and equipment schedule.\\n Improvements to leasehold premises are amortised over the primary lease period subject to a maximum period of five \\nyears.\\n(b) Depreciation\\n Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognised using Straight Line Method (SLM) to expense the cost less \\nresidual values over estimated useful lives as prescribed under schedule II of Company Act, 2013. Estimated useful lives of \\nproperty, plant and equipment as stipulated under Schedule II of the Company Act, 2013 and adopted by management \\nfor various block of assets in as under:\\nAssets Useful life (in years)\\nOffice Premises 60\\nComputers- Servers and networks 6\\nComputers- End user devices, such as, desktops, laptops, etc. 3\\nFurniture and fixtures 10\\nOffice Equipment (including Electrical Installation & Building Management systems) 5\\nGlow Sign Board 2\\nVehicles 8\\n Depreciation on assets purchased or sold during the year is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a pro-rata \\nbasis from the date of addition or as the case may be, up to the date on which the asset is sold.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED99\\nCONSOLIDATED Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each financial year and changes, if any, are \\naccounted prospectively. \\n1.12  Intangible assets\\n(a)  Recognition and measurement\\n Intangible assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortization and \\naccumulated impairment loss, if any.\\n Initial cost of software implementation is capitalised and any subsequent maintenance cost or enhancement cost are \\nexpensed out to statement of profit and loss unless it meets recognition criteria. \\n Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation \\nand accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated \\nuseful lives in the statement of profit and loss. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the \\nend of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. \\n(b)  Useful lives of intangible assets\\n Estimated useful lives of the intangible assets adopted by management are as follows:\\nDescription of assets Useful lives  (In years) Method of amortization \\nComputer software 3 - 6 years SLM\\nWebsite development cost 3 years SLM\\nCopyright licenses 5 years SLM\\n1.13  De-recognition of PPE and Intangible Assets  \\n Carrying amount (net of accumulated depreciation and amortisation) of property, plant and equipment and intangible asset \\nis derecognised upon its disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the \\nasset.\\n Any gains or losses arising on such disposal is determined based on difference between net proceeds and carrying amount \\nand such gains or losses are recognised in statement of profit and loss. \\n1.14  Provisions, Contingent liability and contingent asset \\n Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past events, it is \\nprobable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable \\nestimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\\n The expenses relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement.\\n Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present \\nobligation at the end of reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is pre-tax rate that reflects \\ncurrent market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specified to the liability. The increase in provision due to \\npassage of time is recognised as finance cost. \\n When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a \\nreceivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable \\ncan be measured reliably.\\n Contingent liabilities\\n A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence \\nor non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present obligation that is \\nnot recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent \\nliability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognised because it cannot be measured NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED100\\nCONSOLIDATEDwith sufficient reliability. The Company does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the financial \\nstatements unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is considered remote.\\n Contingent Liabilities in respect of show cause notices are considered only when converted into demands.\\n Loss contingencies arising from claims, litigation, assessment, fines, penalties, etc. are recorded when it is probable that a \\nliability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\\n1.15  Financial instruments \\n Financial instruments\\n Initial recognition\\n The Company recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the \\ninstrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables \\nwhich are initially measured at transaction price. \\n Subsequent measurement\\n Financial assets carried at amortised cost\\n A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold \\nthe asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates \\nto cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\\n Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\\n A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is held within a business \\nmodel whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual \\nterms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the \\nprincipal amount outstanding.\\n The Company has made an irrevocable election for its investments which are classified as equity instruments to present the \\nsubsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income based on its business model. Further, in cases where the \\nCompany has made an irrevocable election based on its business model, for its investments which are classified as equity \\ninstruments, the subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income.\\n Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\\n A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are subsequently fair valued through profit or loss.\\n Derecognition of Financial assets\\n The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or when it \\ntransfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party\\n Impairment of financial assets\\n In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of financial \\nassets other than those measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL). \\n Expected credit losses are measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:\\n• The 12-months expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from those default events on the financial \\ninstrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date); or \\n• Full lifetime expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the life of \\nthe financial instrument) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED101\\nCONSOLIDATED For trade receivables Company applies ‘simplified approach’ which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from \\ninitial recognition of the receivables. The Company uses historical default rates to determine impairment loss on the portfolio \\nof trade receivables. At every reporting date, these historical default rates are reviewed and changes in the forward-looking \\nestimates are analysed. \\n For other assets, the Company uses 12-month ECL to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase in \\ncredit risk. If there is significant increase in credit risk full lifetime ECL is used.\\n Financial liabilities\\n Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost. For trade and other payables maturing within one year from \\nthe Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\\n Derecognition of financial liabilities\\n The Company derecognises financial liabilities when the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired. \\n Equity instruments :\\n All equity investments in scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading are \\nclassified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company decides to classify the same either as at FVTOCI or FVTPL. \\nThe Company makes such election on an instrument-by instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition \\nand is irrevocable. If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the \\ninstrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to Statement of \\nProfit and Loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.\\n Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss.\\n1.16  Earnings per share\\n The basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares \\noutstanding during the year.\\n Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue equity shares \\nwere exercised or converted during the period/year. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average \\nnumber of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding at the year end.\\n1.17  Dividends\\n Final dividends on shares are recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the shareholders and interim dividends are \\nrecorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the company’s Board of Directors.\\n1.18  Standards Issued but not Effective\\n There is no such notification issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) which would have been applicable from \\nApril 1, 2020NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED102\\nCONSOLIDATEDCONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n(` in Lakhs)\\n2.

A fall in the discount rate generally increase the mark to market value of the assets depending on the duration of \\nasset.    \\nSalary Risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of members As such an \\nincrease in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.    \\nInvestment Risk:  The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by \\nreference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will \\ncreate a plan deficit Currently, for the plan in India it has a relatively balanced mix of investments in government securities, and other \\ndebt instruments.    \\nAsset Liability Matching Risk:  The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow Since the plan is invested in lines of Rule 101 of \\nIncome Tax Rules, 1962. this generally reduces ALM risk.    \\nMortality risk: Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan do not have any \\nlongevity risk    \\nConcentration Risk: Plan is having a concentration risk all the assets are invested in the insurance company and a default will wipe out \\nall the assets. Although probability of this is very less as Insurance companies have to follow regulatory guidelines.   \\nGratuity is taken care by separate trust fund and contribution is guided by rule 103 of Income tax rules 1962.   \\nThe principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows.\\nParticulars Valuation as at\\n31 Mar 2020 31 Mar 2019\\nDiscount rate(s) 6.89% 7.79%\\nExpected rate(s) of salary increase 5% p.a 5% p.aCONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED117\\nCONSOLIDATEDAmounts recognised in the statement of profit and loss in respect of these defined benefit plans are as follows. \\n(` In Lakh)\\nParticulars Year ended  \\n31 Mar 2020Year ended  \\n31 Mar 2019\\nService cost:\\n Current service cost  151.44  110.02 \\n Past service cost and (gain)/loss from settlements  -

Liquidity Risk\\nLiquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The company maintains sufficient \\nbank balance and marketable securities such as liquid/ultra-short duration and other debt funds.”  \\n2. Credit Risk \\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing financial \\nloss to the company. The company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business \\nactivities. The company has well defined investment policy restricting investments in various risk categories such high/moderate high/\\nmoderate etc.       \\n3. Foreign currency risk management:    \\nThe company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. \\nExchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.\\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the \\nreporting period are as follows.                                                                                                                        \\n(` in Lakhs)\\nCurrency Liabilities Assets\\nAs at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019As at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019\\nAED - - 7.73 13.23\\nUSD 18.81 44.44 866.81 622.97\\nBHD 22.95 10.28  -    -   \\nAUD  -    -   3.52 2.67\\nJPY  -    -   76.98 82.73\\nSGD  -    -   127.29 151.66\\n /nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED124\\nCONSOLIDATEDCONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nForeign currency sensitivity analysis:    \\nThe following table details the Company’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the Rupee against the relevant foreign \\ncurrencies. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents \\nmanagement’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding \\nforeign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency \\nrates. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or equity where the Rupee strengthens 10% against the relevant currency. \\nFor a 10% weakening of the Rupee against the relevant currency, there would be a comparable impact on the profit or equity, and the \\nbalances below would be negative.  \\n(` in Lakhs)\\nCurrency Impact on profit or loss for the year Impact on total equity as at the end of \\nthe reporting period\\nAs at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019As at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019\\nAED Currency impact  0.58  0.91  0.58  0.91 \\nUSD Currency impact  65.39  39.83  65.39  39.83 \\nBHD Currency impact  1.72  0.67  1.72  0.67 \\nAUD Currency impact  0.26  0.02  0.26  0.02 \\nJPY Currency impact  5.76  2.29  5.76  2.29 \\nSGD Currency impact  9.53  5.47  9.53  5.47 \\nIn management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk because the exposure at the \\nend of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during the year and  considering the size of business and  size of  exposure \\nin Foreign currency is immaterial.    \\n36.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT:\\nFinancial year 2019-20 has seen it all, from the markets reaching its all-time high to three-year returns being erased within a span of a \\nmonth. This year we saw the GDP touching its lowest level in seven years while crude oil fell to levels last seen about 18 years back. The \\nbiggest shock came at the end of the year, the COVID-19 global pandemic on a scale that’s seen once in a lifetime.\\nOverall, the NIFTY delivered negative returns of around 26% for FY19-20. Midcaps and Smallcaps that had started outperforming largecaps \\nby early 2020, gave away all the outperformance and underperformed the largecap indices. When compared to other emerging markets, \\nIndia was a stark underperformer with MSCI India delivering negative returns of nearly 32% (in US$ terms) compared with MSCI Emerging \\nMarket Index’s -20%./nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED6\\nThe fiscal year had started on a positive note helped by a strong political mandate at the center and India being a natural hedge against \\nthe adverse growth impact of US-China trade war. The full majority to BJP led NDA government reinforced the belief in some of the \\npolicies undertaken during their last term; particularly the actions to keep the inflation contained and focus on social security net.  \\nHowever, the slowing economic growth (4.7% in Q3 FY20), the slowest in almost 7 years, and stress in the non-banking financial entities \\nkept the markets jittery. The sharp economic slowdown necessitated policy action at a war scale. The Government responded with big \\nbang reforms on corporate taxes, which boosted market sentiment.  Further, India being integrated with the rest of the world was also \\nimpacted a bit by slowing global growth. \\nDespite a backdrop of weak economic growth, the Indian markets hit fresh highs in early 2020 on expectations of economic recovery. Both \\nservice sector and manufacturing sector PMIs had started looking up. Even the IIP numbers suggested that the economy was turning in \\nthe Jan-Feb 2020 period. However, the recovery was cut short by the sudden outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic.\\nMarkets plummeted consequently in line with the global markets, reacting as much to the lockdown and its economic fallout as to the \\npandemic itself. FPIs (Foreign Portfolio Investors) that had positive inflows for most part of the financial year, sold nearly US$ 8.3bn worth \\nof equities in March alone even as DIIs bought US$ 7.5bn. For the full financial year, FPIs were net buyers to the tune of US$ 1.3 billion \\nin equities. \\nThere will be economic consequences as the world deals with triple shocks simultaneously- supply shock, demand shock, and oil shock \\n(as oil prices plunged after the disagreement between OPEC nations on cutting down of oil supply). Aggressive policy intervention will \\nbe critical in limiting the damage.\\nThe government announced a ` 1.7 trillion stimulus aimed at easing the bottom of the pyramid through the lockdown. At 0.8% of GDP \\nthis would be modest compared to several other countries that have undertaken much larger stimuli; the US for example has approved a \\npackage which is 10% of their GDP. We hope that on the other side of the lockdown, there will be more help from the government. The \\npain that several businesses, especially smaller ones, face around their very survival and the corresponding rise in unemployment, need \\nto be addressed. While poverty in India has usually been associated with rural India, this crisis has brought to fore the plight of the urban \\npoor, who will need focused support as unemployment situation continues to worsen.\\nOn the fixed income markets side, the market rallied in the initial months of the financial year with the budget adhering to fiscal \\nconsolidation, global developments tilting towards monetary easing, accommodative RBI policy on the backdrop of slowing economic \\ngrowth and surplus systemic liquidity. \\nThe bond market remained volatile for the remaining part of the year on concerns about the prospects of fiscal slippage due to tax cut \\nannouncement and on the prospects of additional fiscal stimulus measures given the economic slowdown. With hike in the near-term CPI, \\nRBI kept the policy action on hold post the October 2019 policy and resorted to unconventional actions to ensure that term premiums \\nreduce. These measures were intended to bring down sovereign rates and thereby enable better transmission in the corporate markets \\nover time. \\nLiquidity conditions remained in surplus all through the second half of the financial year, with the effective overnight rates trading \\nsubstantially below the policy rate in all the secured overnight funding markets. The onset of market volatility post the large scale spread \\nof the Covid-19 pandemic across the globe rattled domestic debt markets as large scale FPI outflows were witnessed. \\nThe RBI advanced its scheduled April review and announced an out of schedule policy Repo rate cut by 75bps to 4.40%. Simultaneously \\nCRR was cut by 100 bps along with a Targeted LTRO(Long Term Repo Operations) of ` 1 trillion specifically for purchase of corporate bonds \\nin primary and secondary markets. These extraordinary measures announced at the end of March 2020 had the impact of unwinding the \\nstressed levels witnessed during the preceding few weeks with rates across the curve retracing substantially. While fiscal pressures would \\nmagnify in the current context with the shutdown, RBI direct and indirect accommodation of the same becomes an inevitable option at \\nsome point.\\nThe year was:\\nMarked by regular inflows of assets, the Indian Mutual Fund Industry witnessed a reasonable growth of approximately 10%* in terms \\nof Quarterly AAUM (Average Assets Under Management). The Quarterly AAUM for the industry reached ` 27,02,511 Crores* (March 31, \\n2020) from ` 24,48,121 Crores* (March 31, 2019). The number of new SIP registrations saw an uptick during the year and were more than \\n16.8 million./nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED7\\nSBIFM Pvt Ltd. saw approximately 31.5%* growth in assets during the year - the fastest in the industry, with Quarterly AAUM at ` 3,73,537 \\nCrores* during March 2020 quarter, ( ` 2,83,807 Crore during the March 2019 quarter). Along with growth in Mutual Fund assets, we also \\nsaw huge growth in PMS (Portfolio Management Services) assets with new mandates received from EPFO and SBI staff retirement funds, AIF \\nand Offshore funds accounting to total assets of about ` 10,33,663 Crores as on March 31, 2020 ( ` 3,33,088 Crores as on March 31, 2019).\\n*Source-AMFI, #Source-MFI Explorer\\nMUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY\\nDuring the year under review, following key SEBI Regulations, Guidelines and change in taxation aspects were announced for the Mutual \\nFund Industry.\\n1. Introduction of changes in the Risk Management framework for liquid and overnight funds. viz, holding 20% of net assets of liquid \\nschemes in liquid assets effective from May 01, 2020; no parking of funds pending deployment in Short Term Deposits of Scheduled \\nCommercial Banks; restrictions on investment in debt securities having structured obligations or credit enhancements; levy of exit \\nload on investors who exit the Liquid Fund within 7 days of their investment on a graded basis; cut off timing for applicability of \\nNAV in liquid and overnight funds reduced to 1:30 pm instead of 2 pm.\\n2. Reviewed existing provisions on valuation of money market and debt securities and updated guidelines with best market practices \\nto improve the robustness of valuation of these securities.\\n3. Reviewed mutual funds investment norms for investment in Debt and Money Market Instruments and  revised  norms for investment \\nin listed and unrated debt instruments; restrictions on investment in debt instruments having Structured Obligations / Credit \\nEnhancements; revised the Sector and Group Level Exposure Limits, etc.\\n4. New norms for Debt Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)/Index Funds. The Debt ETF/Index Fund issuer shall ensure compliance to the \\nnorms for rebalancing at the end of every calendar quarter.\\n5. AMCs can now provide management and advisory services in terms of Regulation 24(b) of MF Regulations to FPIs falling under \\ncategories of FPIs as specified in SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations, 2019.\\n6. Mutual Funds and AIFs to follow the Stewardship Code in relation to their investment in listed companies which include monitoring \\nand actively engaging with investee companies on various matters including performance, strategy, corporate governance, material \\nenvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) opportunities or risks, capital structure, etc. \\n7. AMCs are required to complete the KYC in all cases and obtain PAN in all non-PAN exempt cases before processing any transaction \\nincluding redemptions. Accordingly, it is now a mandatory requirement that all investors should complete the KYC requirements \\nfor all normal transactions (including purchases, redemptions, switches and all types of systematic plans) and non-financial requests.\\n8.

Led by regular investor education initiatives by AMFI/SEBI and industry players, the objective to move savers to investing is gaining \\nmomentum. Our focus on investor education initiatives this year was to educate potential investors and savers, including in B30 locations, \\non how mutual funds can act as solutions for their financial goals. We used different communication, advertising and thought-leadership \\nplatforms to engage with them. We continue to believe; this is the way ahead for the industry as we see different customer niches and \\nneeds emerge.\\nThe major investor awareness activities undertaken by us during the year are mentioned as under:\\n1. Development and Dissemination of Investor Education material \\na. Articles – This year we partnered with the India Today Group for a series of investor education articles on different areas of \\npersonal finance, investing and mutual funds. A separate section has been created in the English & Hindi editions of their \\nIndia Today magazine called ‘Nivesh Yatra – The Journey towards Financial Freedom’ for this initiative which publishes articles \\nfor their readers. In addition, we developed brochures from in-house content like ‘Planning for Retirement’ and ’14 Reasons \\nto fall in love with Mutual Funds’ to promote the effectiveness of mutual funds as an investment solution. The content when \\nrequired, is adapted to formats like online mailers/WhatsApp and is circulated to investors and distribution partners alike and \\nhosted on our website blog - Inspire.  /nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED10\\nb. Videos – We worked with content partners to develop videos on hybrid funds and benefits of staying invested. The video \\ntitled ‘Bumpy Ride’ highlights the benefits of staying invested despite ups and downs in market conditions while the second \\nvideo titled “H itesh Ritesh” shows the investment journey of two friends where one chooses to stay invested during volatile \\nmarkets and reaches his financial goals, while the other friend chooses to opt out during tough market conditions. Their \\njourney is beautifully showcased lyrically. We also developed a light-hearted video on Children’s Day with two child artists who \\nare curious to know about things in their surroundings. The message that we wanted to convey was as an investor you must \\nhave many queries about your investments and mutual funds could be an answer for the same. All videos were promoted \\nthrough our social media channels.\\n2. Social Media – Our objective\\xa0on social media\\xa0is to drive more engagement on our\\xa0official social handles by using an approach of \\nunique content, rich formats, and engaging representation.\\xa0Following this approach, we have run quite a few quiz\\xa0series under \\nthe name #SBIMFQuizTime on\\xa0Twitter with an intention to engage with our existing and potential followers\\xa0on different aspects \\nof mutual funds and financial planning.\\xa0We also did some topical content on festivals and occasion such as:\\n a. New Year-\\xa0Get fiscally fit (promoted SIP, ELSS & SWP)\\n b. Valentine’s Day -\\xa014 Reasons to fall in love with Mutual Funds\\n c. Women’s Day -\\xa0Creatives targeting a Homemaker, Working women and Women entrepreneur\\n Other than this we continue to reach out to audiences with various posts on SIP, Equity Investing through Mutual Funds, Fixed \\nMaturity Plans, Use of Systematic Withdrawal Plans for regular\\xa0cash flow\\xa0for expenses and more. Our community on social media \\nplatforms like Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter has crossed over seven lakh followers\\xa0and continues to grow. \\xa0\\xa0\\n3. Online\\xa0Marketing\\xa0–\\xa0We continue to focus on reaching out to millennials who are increasingly preferring a digital experience over \\nthe traditional. One of our investor awareness initiatives of the year was\\xa0#WhatsYourExcuse, aimed at those\\xa0audiences who keep \\ndelaying their investments\\xa0due to various reasons. Concepts like\\xa0online\\xa0investing and\\xa0possibility to register\\xa0SIP\\xa0even when on \\na\\xa0holiday\\xa0online/via an app were specifically made for them.\\xa0\\xa0In addition, we continuously promote concepts\\xa0like SIP,\\xa0Goal-based \\ninvesting through mutual funds\\xa0and ELSS (ELSS means LESS tax) through\\xa0prominent\\xa0domain and finance\\xa0sites like Café Mutual, \\nMorningstar India, Value Research and distribution-led sites like AdvisorKhoj. These activities are supplemented with\\xa0organic and \\naffiliate\\xa0email campaigns which\\xa0help in reach and awareness to a large group of online audiences.\\n4. Public Relations/Media – With the evolving media consumption habits, interaction across social media, print publications, and \\nonline media remains important. We continue to reach out to key media including regional (Newspapers, Magazines, Online and \\nTelevision) to establish thought leadership by getting relevant coverage in large format industry stories, authored articles and Q&A’s \\nwith spokespersons covering business, funds and investment and investor awareness aspects. We also continued to have a sustained \\nfocus on reaching out to potential investors through regional media sharing concepts for investor awareness like our ‘Nivesh Ke \\nNuske’ section in magazines like ‘Nivesh Manthan’\\xa0and highlighting the benefits of mutual funds, financial planning and other \\naspects of personal finance.\\xa0 \\xa0\\n5. Television & On-ground Events – Our association with CNBC Awaaz, a leading Hindi business channel from the CNBC-TV18 network, \\nfor Pehla Kadam – Season 5, a holistic investor education initiative across India, continued this year with an exclusive tie-up to \\npromote mutual funds as an investment option for financial goals. This included a mix of on-ground events, in-studio discussions, \\ncorporate campus events and online/social media. As part of the sponsorship, we plan to have 15 episodes (10 in-studio discussions \\nand 5 episodes compiled from on-ground events) on different facets of financial planning and mutual funds. The on-ground events \\nwill include corporate campus and public auditorium events to engage with first-time investors, homemakers, youth, retail investors, \\nentrepreneur community and retirees. The initiative is also promoted extensively via social media and promos on TV18 channels.\\n6. Media Campaigns – We had a couple of opportunities in the past year to use tactical media campaigns to promote mutual funds \\namongst the masses with the theme/message viral at that point of time.\\na) Cricket World Cup is an important property from an advertising standpoint, as it is once in 4 years, where a lot of ‘eyeballs’ are \\navailable across media. It was an opportune time for us to use this highly viewed event as a tactical opportunity to promote \\nmutual funds amongst the masses and correlate the similarities in Cricket with Mutual Funds. Our investor education campaign, \\n‘Khelo Financial Growth Ka Innings’ , during the World Cup brought out the similarities in scenarios between mutual funds \\nand cricket with advertisements like e.g. Singles can also help win a match (similar to using SIPs to build a corpus) and Long-\\nInnings and Long-term investing both don’t deserve a run out. This was promoted in online media (our website, third-party \\nadvertising and social media) and in select business/personal finance publications like MINT, Business Standard, Financial \\nExpress, Hindu Business Line and ET Wealth./nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED11\\nb) Our next tactical campaign of the year was inspired from the Prime Minister’s Independence Day speech where he laid out \\na vision for India to become a $5 Trillion economy. Our message focused on the fact the policy reforms being put in place \\nby the Government for different sectors will enable them to grow. Thus, an allocation through equity funds can enable an \\ninvestor to build long-term wealth and our message ‘Participate in the journey towards a $5 Trillion economy with Equity \\nFunds’  was to reinforce that equity as an asset class through mutual funds is a convenient option to participate. The campaign \\nwas extensively promoted across outdoor (40 cities), online media (our website, third-party advertising and social media) and \\nprint media (English and 8 Regional language publications - Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Tamil, Kannada, Telegu and \\nPunjabi).\\nc) Equity Linked Saving Schemes (ELSS) continue to be an ideal investment option for those looking to build long-term wealth \\nwhile availing tax benefit on their investments. ‘ELSS means LESS tax’ was our message to investors so the tax-saving message \\nclearly stood out to investors. The message explained in detail in the magazine advertisements how investments in ELSS can \\nhelp save tax while elaborating on the benefits on investing in equity-linked schemes like ELSS to build wealth while getting \\ntax benefit on investments of up to `. 1.5 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The message was promoted through \\nbelow-the-line collaterals like banners, standees as well as in online/social media to increase the reach of the message.\\nd) The last quarter of FY 19-20 saw a lot of market movement, firstly with the downturn in the economy and later with the \\ncoronavirus situation limiting activity worldwide, with fall across large, mid and small cap companies. At such a time, we \\nthought to remind investors that such ‘black swan events’ are opportune times to stay invested as long-term goals should not \\nget affected by these bumps in the road. Our message ‘Don’t take a U-turn on your investments’ was to drive that point across \\nand we exclusively used online media (emailers and social media posts) to promote the same as other media were affected \\ndue to the lockdown in force across the country, while the entire audience was online tracking news and other information.\\n7. The AMC conducted 297 Investor Education meets with 17,487 participants in FY 19-20. In these events, trained professionals \\ndiscussed the importance of savings, financial goals, benefit of compounding in wealth creation, healthy wealthy habits amongst \\nother personal finance topics. Investment awareness videos were screened at these programs with trainers available to explain, \\nclarify or answer various queries. Booklets/Collaterals in regional languages on investor awareness were also distributed in these \\nprograms. We also did an investor awareness program at a Chartered Accountants Conference for nearly 3,200 participants. Our \\ninvestor awareness programs are conducted at State Bank of India Branches, Army Cantonments, CRPF, Air Force stations, Educational \\nInstitutes, Municipal Schools and at Corporate offices of Companies. These events continue to be well received by the investing/\\ngeneral public and are key to spreading financial literacy and awareness across the country.\\nNEW INITIATIVES  \\n1. In FY 2020, SBIFM was certified as a ‘Great Place To Work’ for the period March 2020 to Feb 2021. This is a result of High-Trust and \\nHigh-Performance Culture in the organisation. \\n2. On the digital front, 85% of all lumpsum purchase transactions and 75% of all SIP transactions were registered digitally. Despite \\ndiscontinuation of Aadhaar based on-boarding, last year over 10.85 lacs, i.e. 61% of new investors of SBI Mutual Fund were added \\ndigitally. We also launched voice assistants on Alexa and Google Home devices. We have also created ‘smart statement’ of accounts \\nwhich redefines online statement of accounts by including several insights on one’s investments.\\xa0 Further, we introduced the \\nWhatsApp Chatbot in March 2020, which already has over 14,000 registered users.\\n3. Our focus continued to be on the B30 locations as our endeavour is to grow organically through higher penetration in these \\ngeographies. To further boost our efforts in B30 locations, we have launched 14 new Branches in the year taking the total number \\nof Branches to 222 including 176 in B30 locations.\\n4. We have also gained a fair share of the industry SIP book as SIP is one of the strongest investment tools available to investors and it \\nalso adds to regular and sustainable long term inflows in core assets. In March 2020, our SIP book stood at  `1,180 crores as compared \\nto  ` 1,056 crores as of March 2019. \\n5. With a view to build a sustainable business for all the stakeholders and putting investors safety first, we continuously work towards  \\nenhancing our risk mitigation processes and the same has proven to be effective in FY 2020. \\n6. In FY 2020, SBIFM became the first AMC in the country to be fully compliant with the Global Investment Performance Standards( \\nGIPS), administered by the CFA Institute. GIPS is a global guide for the principles that investment companies need to follow while \\ncalculating and presenting performance data to clients. This adds another layer of credibility to our business functioning through \\na fair representation of the performance to our customers /nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED12\\n7. With the focus on customer service, SBIFM continues to invest significantly in this segment to help investors throughout their \\ninvestment journey. We have addressed many customer pain points by gathering customer feedback, process improvements, system \\nenhancements, strengthened governance around repeated queries and upskilling of teams along with speedy resolution. We have \\nmade continuous improvement in On-boarding and Investment processes by providing enhanced digital solutions both for our \\ninvestors and distributors. Overall complaints continue to trend downwards. \\n8. We have substantially grown our PMS institutional book by On-boarding some of the most esteemed and the largest PF (Provident \\nFund) organisations. \\n9. From customer’s perspective, SBI Mutual Fund continues to believe in offering investment solutions rather than a product-selling \\napproach.\\xa0 Accordingly, we launched services such as SWP – A, SIP Top up cap, SIP Pause etc. during the year. \\nVII. CHANGE IN NATURE OF BUSINESS \\nThere was no change in the nature of business during the year under review.\\nVIII. MATERIAL CHANGES AND COMMITMENTS, IF ANY AFFECTING THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE COMPANY \\nWHICH HAVE OCCURED IN BETWEEN THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR OF THE COMPANY TO WHICH THE FINANCIAL \\nSTATEMENTS RELATE AND THE DATE OF THE REPORT\\nThere have been no material changes and commitments affecting the financial position of the Company which have occurred between \\nthe end of the financial year 2019-20 and the date of this report.\\nIX. FUTURE PLANS\\n1. FY 20-21 has begun amidst COVID-19 - a completely unprecedented situation. Everyone in the industry and across the globe has \\nbeen affected by it. While everyone is trying innovative ways to ensure business continuity, the real challenge will be the new world \\nthat we will be a part of once this is over and we enter a new normal. \\n2. From the business perspective, we expect FY 20-21 to be a challenging year for the entire industry, both from the perspective of \\ngrowth in assets as well as pressure on margins. We will accordingly focus on cost optimization through forward and backward \\nintegration. However, we will continue to invest in the core needs of business enhancement. We will also make significant investments \\ninto technology to protect our data and develop highest standards of data security.\\n3. On the digital front, we will continue to work on making the customer journey more personalised and effective in better investment \\nplanning. We will work on a data platform project which will help in various analytics use-cases for business impact.\\xa0\\n4. In terms of our product basket, we will continue to add funds, both from the point of view of introducing innovative products and \\naddressing product gaps. We will have products across solution-oriented and debt categories. We will also continue to expand our \\npassive offerings.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the \\nStandalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued \\nby the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the independence requirements that are relevant to our audit \\nof the Standalone Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical \\nresponsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained \\nis sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements.\\nInformation Other than the Standalone Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon\\nThe Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of other information. The other information comprises the information \\nincluded in the Director’s Report but does not include the Standalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Director’s \\nreport is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report. \\nOur opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance \\nconclusion thereon. \\nIn connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above \\nwhen it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone Financial \\nStatements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\\nManagement’s Responsibility for the Standalone Financial Statements\\nThe Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of \\nthese standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, total comprehensive \\nincome, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted \\nin India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for \\nsafeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application \\nof appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and \\nmaintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the \\naccounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view \\nand are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.STANDALONE/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED29\\nIn preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going \\nconcern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management \\neither intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\\nThe Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.\\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from material \\nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high \\nlevel of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement \\nwhen it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could \\nreasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the \\naudit.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our \\nauditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify \\nour opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future \\nevents or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern;\\n•\\t Evaluate\\t the\\toverall\\tpresentation,\\t structure\\t and\\tcontent\\t of\\tthe\\tStandalone\\t Financial\\t Statements,\\t including\\t the\\tdisclosures,\\t and\\t\\nwhether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair \\npresentation;\\nMateriality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable \\nthat the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the standalone financial statements may be influenced.

These estimates, judgements and \\nassumptions affect application of accounting policies and the reported amount of assets, liabilities, disclosure of contingent \\nassets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amount of income and expenses for the periods \\npresented.\\n In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting \\npolicies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements are as below:\\n•\\t Financial instruments\\n•\\t Property,\\tplant\\tand\\tequipment\\n•\\t Intangible\\tassets\\n•\\t Obligation\\trelating\\tto\\temployee\\tbenefits\\t\\n•\\t Provisions\\tand\\tcontingencies\\n•\\t Provision\\tfor\\tincome\\ttaxes,\\tincluding\\tamount\\texpected\\tto\\tbe\\tpaid/recovered\\tfor\\tuncertain\\ttax\\tpositions.\\n•\\t Scheme\\texpenses\\n1.5  Investments in subsidiaries and associates  \\n Investments in subsidiaries and associates are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any in its separate financial \\nstatements. Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed and written down \\nimmediately to its recoverable amount. On disposal of such investments, the difference between net disposal proceeds and \\nthe carrying amount are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.The company has elected deemed cost exemption as \\nper Ind AS 101.\\n1.6  Revenue recognition\\n1.6.1  Revenue from Operations\\n The company recognises revenue when amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that future \\neconomic benefits will flow to the company, regardless of when payment is being made.\\n Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually \\ndefined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government. \\n The following is the description of the activities of the business from which the Company generates its revenue:\\n(a) Management Fees:\\n Management fee is recognized at specific rates agreed with the relevant schemes in terms of scheme document, \\napplied on the average daily net assets of each scheme (excluding inter-scheme investments, wherever applicable, \\ninvestments made by the Company in the respective scheme and deposits with Banks), and are in conformity with \\nthe limits specified under SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. Management fees on AIF schemes are recognized \\nat specific rates agreed with relevant schemes in terms of offer document, applied on daily average asset of each \\nschemes.\\n(b) Portfolio Advisory services and Portfolio Management services: \\n Portfolio advisory services and Portfolio Management services income is recognized as per the contractual \\narrangement.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED44\\n1.6.2  Other Income:\\n(a) Dividend income:\\n Dividend income from investments is recognised when the right to receive payment has been established, which \\nis generally when shareholders approve the dividend. On investments in certain mutual funds, the company is \\nentitled to a daily / weekly dividend. This dividend is accounted for at such frequency as the right to receive \\npayment is established.\\n(b)  Interest income:\\n Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to \\nthe Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by \\nreference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate (EIR) applicable, which is the rate that \\nexactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net \\ncarrying amount on initial recognition. Interest income is included in finance income in the statement of profit \\nand loss. In case of staff loans interest income is recognised on accrual basis.\\n1.7  Scheme Expenses \\n(a)  Recurring expenses of schemes borne by the Company are recognised under respective expense heads in the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss unless considered recoverable from the schemes in accordance with provisions of SEBI (Mutual Fund) \\nRegulations 1996 and circular issued from time to time.\\n Expenses of schemes of SBI Mutual Fund, in excess of the stipulated rates, are required to be borne by the Company in \\naccordance with the requirements of SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, and as such, are charged to the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss.\\n(b)  Brokerage: Brokerage and/or Incentive paid on investments in open-ended Equity Linked Tax Saving Schemes and \\nSystematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are amortized over a period of 36 months and in case of other schemes, over the claw \\nback period from beginning of the month brokerage is paid. In case of Close ended schemes, brokerage is amortized \\nover the tenure of schemes.\\n(c)  New Fund Offer Expenses: Expenses relating to new fund offer of SBI Mutual Fund are charged to the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss in the year in which they are incurred in accordance with the requirements of SEBI (Mutual Fund) \\nRegulations, 1996.\\n1.8  Leases\\n The Company as a lessee The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for office on lease and other assets . \\nThe Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if \\nthe contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. \\nTo assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) \\nthe contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use \\nof the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. At the date of \\ncommencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all \\nlease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low \\nvalue leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense \\non a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \\n Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU \\nassets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. The right-of-use \\nassets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments \\nmade at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are \\nsubsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from \\nthe commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED45\\nRight of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying \\namounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair \\nvalue less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash \\nflows that are largely independent of those from other assets. \\n The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments \\nare discounted using the interest rate. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of \\nuse asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. Lease liability \\nand ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash \\nflows. \\n1.9 Foreign currencies\\n(a)  Functional and presentation currency\\n Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of primary economic environment in which \\nthe company operates (‘the Functional currency’). The functional currency of the company is determined to be Indian \\nrupee (INR). The financial statements are presented in Indian rupee and rounded off to the nearest lakhs except shares \\nand per share data.\\n(b)  Foreign Currency Transactions and translations\\n Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using respective currency exchange rates prevailing \\non the date of transaction first qualify for recognition.\\ni. Monetary items:\\n Foreign exchange gains or losses realized up on settlement of transactions or translation of monetary assets \\nand liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in profit and loss account using reporting date \\nexchange rates.\\nii. Non-monetary items : \\n Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the \\nexchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. \\n Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into functional currency \\nat the exchange rate when fair value is determined. \\n The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the \\nrecognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose \\nfair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).\\n1.10  Employee benefits  \\n(a)  Defined Contribution Plan :\\n- Provident Fund  \\n The Company has defined contribution plans for post-employment benefits in the form of Provident fund. Under \\nthe Provident Fund plan, the company contributes to Government administered Provident Fund on behalf of \\nemployees. The Company has no further obligation beyond making the contribution. \\n The Company’s contribution to Government Provident Fund is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n- Superannuation  \\n Superannuation fund is a defined contribution scheme. In case employee opts for superannuation fund, the \\nCompany contributes a sum equivalent to 15% of basic salary plus dearness pay of the eligible managerial cadre \\nemployees’ salary to the Superannuation Fund administered by trustees and managed by the Life Insurance NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED46\\nCorporation of India. The Company recognizes such contribution as an expense as and when incurred.\\n- National Pension Scheme\\n National Pension Scheme is a defined contribution scheme. In case employee opts for National Pension Scheme, \\nthe Company contributes a sum not exceeding 10% of basic salary plus dearness pay of the eligible employees’ \\nsalary to the National Pension Scheme. The Company recognizes such contribution as an expense as and when \\nincurred.\\n(b)  Defined Benefit Plan:  Gratuity  \\n Gratuity liability is a defined benefit obligation and is funded through a Gratuity Fund administered by trustees \\nand managed by the Life Insurance Corporation of India. The Company accounts for liability for future gratuity \\nbenefits based on the actuarial valuation using Projected Unit Credit Method carried out as at the end of each \\nfinancial year. Actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognized in the Statement of Profit and loss. \\n Gratuity liabilities are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an independent actuary, at each reporting \\ndate using the projected unit credit method. The Company recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit \\nplan in its balance sheet as an asset or liability, as the case may be. The discount rate is based on the government \\nsecurities yield. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions \\nare recorded in other comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which \\nthey arise.\\n(c)  Other Long-term employee benefit obligation : Compensated absences\\n The company provides for the encashment of leave or leave with pay subject to certain rules. The employees are \\nentitled to accumulate leave subject to certain limits, for future encashment. The liability is provided based on the \\nnumber of days of unutilized leave at each balance sheet date on the basis of an independent actuarial valuation \\ncarried out as at the end of each financial year. \\n(d)  Employee Share Based Payments:\\n Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair \\nvalue of the equity instruments at the grant date.\\n The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on amortised \\nbasis over the vesting period, based on the Company\\'s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, \\nwith a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of \\nthe number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is \\nrecognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding \\nadjustment to the equity-settled employee benefits reserve.\\n1.11  Income taxes\\n Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year. \\nCurrent and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised \\nin other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other \\ncomprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\\n(a) Current tax\\n Current income tax for current and prior period is recognised at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid \\nto the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted at the \\nreporting date.\\n Current income taxes are recognised in the statement of profit and loss except for items those are recognised outside \\nprofit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity), related tax for such items are recognised either in \\nOther Comprehensive income or in Equity.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED47\\n Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax \\npaid and income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying units intends to \\nsettle the asset and liability on a net basis. \\n(b) Deferred tax\\n Deferred income tax is recognized using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are \\nmeasured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, \\nbased on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. \\n The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent \\nthat it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset \\nto be recovered. \\n Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences except for investment in subsidiaries \\nand associates, when the timings of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that \\nthe temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. \\n1.12  Property, plant and equipment\\n(a)  Recognition and measurement\\n All items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment \\nlosses, if any. Historical cost includes expenses directly attributable to the acquisition of an asset.\\n Advances paid towards the acquisition of property and equipment and the cost of property and equipment not ready \\nfor use before the reporting date are disclosed separately in the property and equipment schedule.\\n Improvements to leasehold premises are amortised over the primary lease period subject to a maximum period of five \\nyears.\\n(b) Depreciation\\n Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognised using Straight Line Method (SLM) to expense the cost less \\nresidual values over estimated useful lives as prescribed under Schedule II of Companies Act, 2013. Estimated useful \\nlives of property, plant and equipment as stipulated under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 and adopted by \\nmanagement for various block of assets in as under:\\nAssets Useful life (in years)\\nOffice Premises 60\\nComputers- Servers and networks 6\\nComputers- End user devices, such as, desktops, laptops, etc. 3\\nFurniture and fixtures 10\\nOffice Equipment (including Electrical Installation & Building Management systems) 5\\nGlow Sign Board 2\\nVehicles 8\\n Depreciation on assets purchased or sold during the year is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a pro-rata \\nbasis from the date of addition or as the case may be, up to the date on which the asset is sold.\\n All fixed assets individually costing less than ` 5,000 are fully depreciated in the year of purchase/acquisition.\\n Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each financial year and changes, if any, are \\naccounted prospectively. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED48\\n1.13  Intangible assets\\n(a)  Recognition and measurement\\n Intangible assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortization \\nand accumulated impairment loss, if any.\\n Initial cost of software implementation is capitalised and any subsequent maintenance cost or enhancement cost \\nare expensed out to statement of profit and loss unless it meets recognition criteria. \\n Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation \\nand accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated \\nuseful lives in the statement of profit and loss. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at \\nthe end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective \\nbasis. \\n(b)  Useful lives of intangible assets\\n Estimated useful lives of the intangible assets adopted by management are as follows:\\nDescription of assets Useful lives \\n (In years)Method of depreciation / \\namortization \\nComputer software 3 - 6 years SLM\\nWebsite development cost 3 years SLM\\nCopyright licenses 5 years SLM\\n1.14  De-recognition of PPE and Intangible Assets\\n Carrying amount (net of accumulated depreciation and amortisation) of property, plant and equipment and intangible \\nasset is derecognised upon its disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued \\nuse of the asset.\\n Any gains or losses arising on such disposal is determined based on difference between net proceeds and carrying \\namount and such gains or losses are recognised in statement of profit and loss. \\n1.15  Provisions, Contingent liability and contingent asset \\n Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past events, \\nit is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and \\na reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\\n The expenses relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement.\\n Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the \\npresent obligation at the end of reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is pre-tax rate \\nthat reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specified to the liability. The increase \\nin provision due to passage of time is recognised as finance cost. \\n When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third \\nparty, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount \\nof the receivable can be measured reliably.\\n Contingent liabilities\\n A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the \\noccurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present \\nobligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the \\nobligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognised \\nbecause it cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. The Company does not recognize a contingent liability but NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED49\\ndiscloses its existence in the financial statements unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is considered \\nremote.\\n Contingent Liabilities in respect of show cause notices are considered only when converted into demands.\\n Loss contingencies arising from claims, litigation, assessment, fines, penalties, etc. are recorded when it is probable that \\na liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\\n1.16  Financial instruments  \\n Financial instruments\\n Initial recognition\\n The Company recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions \\nof the instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade \\nreceivables which are initially measured at transaction price. \\n Subsequent measurement\\n Financial assets carried at amortised cost\\n A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to \\nhold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on \\nspecified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\\n Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\\n A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is held within a \\nbusiness model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the \\ncontractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal \\nand interest on the principal amount outstanding.\\n The Company has made an irrevocable election for its investments which are classified as equity instruments to present \\nthe subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income based on its business model. Further, in cases where \\nthe Company has made an irrevocable election based on its business model, for its investments which are classified as \\nequity instruments, the subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income.\\n Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\\n A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are subsequently fair valued through profit or \\nloss.\\n Derecognition of Financial assets\\n The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or when \\nit transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party\\n Impairment of financial assets\\n In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of \\nfinancial assets other than those measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL). \\n Expected credit losses are measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:\\n•\\t The\\t 12-months\\t expected\\t credit\\tlosses\\t(expected\\t credit\\tlosses\\tthat\\tresult\\tfrom\\tthose\\tdefault\\tevents\\ton\\tthe\\tfinancial\\t\\ninstrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date); or \\n•\\t Full\\t lifetime\\t expected\\t credit\\tlosses\\t(expected\\t credit\\tlosses\\tthat\\tresult\\tfrom\\tall\\tpossible\\t default\\tevents\\tover\\tthe\\tlife\\t\\nof the financial instrument) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED50\\n For trade receivables Company applies ‘simplified approach’ which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised \\nfrom initial recognition of the receivables. The Company uses historical default rates to determine impairment loss on \\nthe portfolio of trade receivables. At every reporting date, these historical default rates are reviewed and changes in \\nthe forward-looking estimates are analysed. \\n For other assets, the Company uses 12-month ECL to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase \\nin credit risk. If there is significant increase in credit risk full lifetime ECL is used.\\n Financial liabilities\\n Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost. For trade and other payables maturing within one year \\nfrom the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\\n Derecognition of financial liabilities\\n The Company derecognises financial liabilities when the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have \\nexpired. \\n Equity instruments :\\n All equity investments in scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading \\nare classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company decides to classify the same either as at FVTOCI \\nor FVTPL. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by instrument basis. The classification is made on initial \\nrecognition and is irrevocable. If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value \\nchanges on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from \\nOCI to Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative \\ngain or loss within equity.\\n Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the \\nStatement of Profit and Loss.\\n1.17  Earnings per share\\n The basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity \\nshares outstanding during the year.\\n Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue equity \\nshares were exercised or converted during the period/year. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted \\naverage number of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding at the year end.\\n1.18  Dividends\\n Final dividends on shares are recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the shareholders and interim dividends \\nare recorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the company’s Board of Directors.\\n1.19  Standards Issued but not Effective\\n There is no such notification issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) which would have been applicable \\nfrom April 1, 2020.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED51\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n(` in Lakhs)\\n2.

The fund has the form of a trust and it is \\ngoverned by the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition \\nof the Investment strategy .   \\nRisks associated with defined benefit plan    \\nGratuity is a defined benefit plan and company is exposed to the Following Risks:    \\nInterest rate risk:  A fall in the discount rate which is linked to the G.Sec Rate will Increase the present value of the liability requiring \\nhigher provision. A fall in the discount rate generally increase the mark to market value of the assets depending on the duration of \\nasset.    \\nSalary Risk:  The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of members As such an \\nincrease in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.    \\nInvestment Risk:  The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by \\nreference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will \\ncreate a plan deficit. Currently, for the plan in India it has a relatively balanced mix of investments in government securities, and other \\ndebt instruments.    \\nAsset Liability Matching Risk:  The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow Since the plan is invested in lines of Rule 101 of \\nIncome Tax Rules, 1962. this generally reduces ALM risk.    \\nMortality risk:  Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan do not have any \\nlongevity risk    \\nConcentration Risk:  Plan is having a concentration risk all the assets are invested in the insurance company and a default will wipe out \\nall the assets. Although probability of this is very less as Insurance companies have to follow regulatory guidelines.   \\nGratuity is taken care by separate trust fund and contribution is guided by Rule 103 of Income Tax Rules 1962.   \\nThe principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows.\\nParticulars Valuation as at\\n31 Mar 2020 31 Mar 2019\\nDiscount rate(s) 6.89% 7.79%\\nExpected rate(s) of salary increase 5% p.a 5% p.aNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSSTANDALONE/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED66\\nAmounts recognised in the statement of profit and loss in respect of these defined benefit plans are as follows. \\n(` In Lakh)\\nParticulars Year ended  \\n31 Mar 2020Year ended  \\n31 Mar 2019\\nService cost:\\n Current service cost  151.44  110.02 \\n Past service cost and (gain)/loss from settlements  -

Liquidity Risk \\nLiquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The company maintains sufficient \\nbank balance and marketable securities such as liquid/ultra-short duration and other debt funds.\\n2. Credit Risk \\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing financial \\nloss to the company. The company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business \\nactivities. The company has well defined investment policy restricting investments in various risk categories such high/moderate high/\\nmoderate etc.\\n3. Foreign currency risk management:    \\nThe company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. \\nExchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.\\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the \\nreporting period are as follows.     \\n(` in Lakhs)\\nCurrency Liabilities Assets\\nAs at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019As at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019\\nAED - 7.73 13.23\\nUSD 18.81 44.44 866.81 622.97\\nBHD 22.95 10.28                    -                     -   \\nAUD -                       -   3.52 2.67\\nJPY                   -                         -   76.98 82.73\\nSGD                   -                         -   127.29 151.66\\n \\nForeign currency sensitivity analysis:    \\nThe following table details the Company’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the Rupee against the relevant foreign \\ncurrencies. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents \\nmanagement’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued \\nby the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the independence requirements that are relevant to our audit \\nof the consolidated financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other \\nethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have \\nobtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\\nInformation Other than the Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon\\nThe Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of other information. The other information comprises the information \\nincluded in the Director’s Report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Director’s \\nreport is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report. \\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance \\nconclusion thereon. \\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above \\nwhen it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated \\nfinancial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. \\nManagement’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nThe Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation \\nof these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial \\nperformance, consolidated total comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Company \\nin accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. The respective Board of Directors of the \\ncompanies included in the Group,  and its associates are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with \\nthe provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; \\nselection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, \\nimplementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and \\ncompleteness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give /nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED81\\nCONSOLIDATEDa true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error , which have been used for the purpose of \\npreparation of these Consolidated  Financial Statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.\\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going \\nconcern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management \\neither intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\\nThose respective Board of Directors included in the group are also responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.\\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material \\nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high \\nlevel of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when \\nit exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably \\nbe expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the \\naudit. We also:\\nl Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design \\nand perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a \\nbasis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from \\nerror, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; \\nl Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate \\nin the circumstances. Under section 143(3) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding \\nCompany, its subsidiary companies and its associate companies which are incorporated in India has adequate internal financial \\ncontrols with reference to the consolidated financial statements, in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls;\\nl Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures \\nmade by management;\\nl Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence \\nobtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s \\nability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our \\nauditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify \\nour opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future \\nevents or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\\nl Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and \\nwhether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair \\npresentation;\\nl Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group \\nto express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance \\nof the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements.\\nMateriality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it \\nprobable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial statements may be influenced. We consider \\nquantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and \\n(ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the financial statements.\\nWe communicate with the Management, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, \\nincluding any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding \\nindependence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our \\nindependence, and where applicable, related safeguards./nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED82\\nCONSOLIDATEDOther Matter\\nWe did not audit the financial statements of foreign subsidiary whose financial statements reflect total assets of Rs. 318.05 Lakh as at \\n31st March 2020, total revenues of Rs. 426.32 Lakh and net cash outflows amounting to Rs.0.36 Lakh for the year ended on that date, as \\nconsidered in the consolidated financial statements.

These estimates, judgements and \\nassumptions affect application of accounting policies and the reported amount of assets, liabilities, disclosure of contingent \\nassets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amount of income and expenses for the periods \\npresented.\\n In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting \\npolicies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements are as below:\\n• Financial instruments\\n• Property, plant and equipment\\n• Intangible assets\\n• Obligation relating to employee benefits \\n• Provisions and contingencies\\n• Provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.\\n• Scheme expenses\\n1.5  Revenue recognition\\n1.5.1  Revenue from Operations\\n The company recognises revenue when amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that future \\neconomic benefits will flow to the company, regardless of when payment is being made.\\n Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually \\ndefined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government. \\n The following is the description of the activities of the business from which the Company generates its revenue:\\n(a) Management Fees:\\n Management fee is recognized at specific rates agreed with the relevant schemes in terms of scheme document, \\napplied on the average daily net assets of each scheme (excluding inter-scheme investments, wherever applicable, \\ninvestments made by the Company in the respective scheme and deposits with Banks), and are in conformity with \\nthe limits specified under SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. Management fees on AIF schemes are recognized \\nat specific rates agreed with relevant schemes in terms of offer document, applied on daily average asset of each \\nschemes.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED95\\nCONSOLIDATED(b) Portfolio Advisory services and Portfolio Management services: \\n Portfolio advisory services and Portfolio Management services income is recognized as per the contractual \\narrangement.\\n1.5.2  Other Income:\\n(a) Dividend income:\\n Dividend income from investments is recognised when the right to receive payment has been established, which \\nis generally when shareholders approve the dividend. On investments in certain mutual funds, the company is \\nentitled to a daily / weekly dividend. This dividend is accounted for at such frequency as the right to receive \\npayment is established.\\n(b)  Interest income:\\n Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to \\nthe Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by \\nreference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate (EIR) applicable, which is the rate that \\nexactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net \\ncarrying amount on initial recognition. Interest income is included in finance income in the statement of profit \\nand loss. In case of staff loans interest income is recognised on accrual basis.\\n1.6  Scheme Expenses \\n(a)  Recurring expenses of schemes borne by the Company are recognised under respective expense heads in the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss unless considered recoverable from the schemes in accordance with provisions of SEBI (Mutual Fund) \\nRegulations 1996 and circular issued from time to time.\\n Expenses of schemes of SBI Mutual Fund, in excess of the stipulated rates, are required to be borne by the Company in \\naccordance with the requirements of SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations, 1996, and as such, are charged to the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss.\\n(b)  Brokerage: Brokerage and/or Incentive paid on investments in open-ended Equity Linked Tax Saving Schemes and \\nSystematic Investment Plans (SIPs) are amortized over a period of 36 months and in case of other schemes, over the claw \\nback period from beginning of the month brokerage is paid. In case of Close ended schemes, brokerage is amortized \\nover the tenure of schemes.\\n(c)  New Fund Offer Expenses: Expenses relating to new fund offer of SBI Mutual Fund are charged to the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss in the year in which they are incurred in accordance with the requirements of SEBI (Mutual Fund) \\nRegulations, 1996.\\n1.7  Leases\\n The Company as a lessee The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for office on lease and other assets . \\nThe Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if \\nthe contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. \\nTo assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) \\nthe contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use \\nof the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. At the date of \\ncommencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all \\nlease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low \\nvalue leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense \\non a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \\n Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU \\nassets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. The right-of-use NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED96\\nCONSOLIDATEDassets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments \\nmade at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are \\nsubsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from \\nthe commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. \\nRight of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying \\namounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair \\nvalue less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash \\nflows that are largely independent of those from other assets. \\n The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments \\nare discounted using the interest rate. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of \\nuse asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. Lease liability \\nand ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash \\nflows. \\n1.8  Foreign currencies\\n(a)  Functional and presentation currency\\n Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of primary economic environment in which \\nthe company operates (‘the Functional currency’). The functional currency of the company is determined to be Indian \\nrupee (INR). The financial statements are presented in Indian rupee and rounded off to the nearest lakhs except shares \\nand per share data.\\n(b)  Foreign Currency Transactions and translations\\n Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using respective currency exchange rates prevailing \\non the date of transaction first qualify for recognition.\\ni. Monetary items:\\n Foreign exchange gains or losses realized up on settlement of transactions or translation of monetary assets \\nand liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in profit and loss account using reporting date \\nexchange rates.\\nii.  Non-monetary items : \\n Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the \\nexchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. \\n Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into functional currency \\nat the exchange rate when fair value is determined. \\n The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the \\nrecognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose \\nfair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).\\n1.9  Employee benefits  \\n(a)  Defined Contribution Plan :\\n- Provident Fund  \\n The Company has defined contribution plans for post-employment benefits in the form of Provident fund. Under \\nthe Provident Fund plan, the company contributes to Government administered Provident Fund on behalf of \\nemployees. The Company has no further obligation beyond making the contribution. \\n The Company’s contribution to Government Provident Fund is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED97\\nCONSOLIDATED- Superannuation  \\n Superannuation fund is a defined contribution scheme. In case employee opts for superannuation fund, the Company \\ncontributes a sum equivalent to 15% of basic salary plus dearness pay of the eligible managerial cadre employees’ \\nsalary to the Superannuation Fund administered by trustees and managed by the Life Insurance Corporation of \\nIndia. The Company recognizes such contribution as an expense as and when incurred.\\n- National Pension Scheme\\n National Pension Scheme is a defined contribution scheme. In case employee opts for National Pension Scheme, \\nthe Company contributes a sum not exceeding 10% of basic salary plus dearness pay of the eligible employees’ \\nsalary to the National Pension Scheme. The Company recognizes such contribution as an expense as and when \\nincurred.\\n(b)  Defined Benefit Plan:  Gratuity  \\n Gratuity liability is a defined benefit obligation and is funded through a Gratuity Fund administered by trustees and \\nmanaged by the Life Insurance Corporation of India. The Company accounts for liability for future gratuity benefits \\nbased on the actuarial valuation using Projected Unit Credit Method carried out as at the end of each financial year. \\nActuarial gains and losses are immediately recognized in the Statement of Profit and loss. \\n Gratuity liabilities are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an independent actuary, at each reporting date \\nusing the projected unit credit method. The Company recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit plan in its \\nbalance sheet as an asset or liability, as the case may be. The discount rate is based on the government securities yield. \\nActuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recorded in \\nother comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.\\n(c)  Other Long-term employee benefit obligation : Compensated absences\\n The company provides for the encashment of leave or leave with pay subject to certain rules. The employees are entitled \\nto accumulate leave subject to certain limits, for future encashment. The liability is provided based on the number of \\ndays of unutilized leave at each balance sheet date on the basis of an independent actuarial valuation carried out as \\nat the end of each financial year. \\n(d)  Employee Share Based Payments:\\n Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value \\nof the equity instruments at the grant date.\\n The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on amortised \\nbasis over the vesting period, based on the Company\\'s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a \\ncorresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number \\nof equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in \\nprofit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the \\nequity-settled employee benefits reserve.\\n1.10  Income taxes\\n Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year. \\nCurrent and deferred taxes are recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, except when they relate to items \\nthat are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also \\nrecognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\\n(a) Current tax\\n Current income tax for current and prior period is recognised at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid \\nto the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted at the \\nreporting date.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED98\\nCONSOLIDATED Current income taxes are recognised in the statement of profit and loss except for items those are recognised outside \\nprofit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity), related tax for such items are recognised either in \\nOther Comprehensive income or in Equity.\\n Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax \\npaid and income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying units intends to \\nsettle the asset and liability on a net basis. \\n(b) Deferred tax\\n Deferred income tax is recognized using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are \\nmeasured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, \\nbased on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. \\n The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent \\nthat it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset \\nto be recovered. \\n Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences except for investment in subsidiaries \\nand associates, when the timings of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that \\nthe temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  \\n The Group offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right to set off the \\nrecognized amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability \\nsimultaneously.\\n1.11  Property, plant and equipment\\n(a)  Recognition and measurement\\n All items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment \\nlosses, if any. Historical cost includes expenses directly attributable to the acquisition of an asset.\\n Advances paid towards the acquisition of property and equipment and the cost of property and equipment not ready \\nfor use before the reporting date are disclosed separately in the property and equipment schedule.\\n Improvements to leasehold premises are amortised over the primary lease period subject to a maximum period of five \\nyears.\\n(b) Depreciation\\n Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognised using Straight Line Method (SLM) to expense the cost less \\nresidual values over estimated useful lives as prescribed under schedule II of Company Act, 2013. Estimated useful lives of \\nproperty, plant and equipment as stipulated under Schedule II of the Company Act, 2013 and adopted by management \\nfor various block of assets in as under:\\nAssets Useful life (in years)\\nOffice Premises 60\\nComputers- Servers and networks 6\\nComputers- End user devices, such as, desktops, laptops, etc. 3\\nFurniture and fixtures 10\\nOffice Equipment (including Electrical Installation & Building Management systems) 5\\nGlow Sign Board 2\\nVehicles 8\\n Depreciation on assets purchased or sold during the year is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a pro-rata \\nbasis from the date of addition or as the case may be, up to the date on which the asset is sold.NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED99\\nCONSOLIDATED Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each financial year and changes, if any, are \\naccounted prospectively. \\n1.12  Intangible assets\\n(a)  Recognition and measurement\\n Intangible assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortization and \\naccumulated impairment loss, if any.\\n Initial cost of software implementation is capitalised and any subsequent maintenance cost or enhancement cost are \\nexpensed out to statement of profit and loss unless it meets recognition criteria. \\n Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation \\nand accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated \\nuseful lives in the statement of profit and loss. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the \\nend of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. \\n(b)  Useful lives of intangible assets\\n Estimated useful lives of the intangible assets adopted by management are as follows:\\nDescription of assets Useful lives  (In years) Method of amortization \\nComputer software 3 - 6 years SLM\\nWebsite development cost 3 years SLM\\nCopyright licenses 5 years SLM\\n1.13  De-recognition of PPE and Intangible Assets  \\n Carrying amount (net of accumulated depreciation and amortisation) of property, plant and equipment and intangible asset \\nis derecognised upon its disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the \\nasset.\\n Any gains or losses arising on such disposal is determined based on difference between net proceeds and carrying amount \\nand such gains or losses are recognised in statement of profit and loss. \\n1.14  Provisions, Contingent liability and contingent asset \\n Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past events, it is \\nprobable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable \\nestimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\\n The expenses relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement.\\n Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present \\nobligation at the end of reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is pre-tax rate that reflects \\ncurrent market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specified to the liability. The increase in provision due to \\npassage of time is recognised as finance cost. \\n When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a \\nreceivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable \\ncan be measured reliably.\\n Contingent liabilities\\n A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence \\nor non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present obligation that is \\nnot recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent \\nliability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognised because it cannot be measured NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED100\\nCONSOLIDATEDwith sufficient reliability. The Company does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the financial \\nstatements unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is considered remote.\\n Contingent Liabilities in respect of show cause notices are considered only when converted into demands.\\n Loss contingencies arising from claims, litigation, assessment, fines, penalties, etc. are recorded when it is probable that a \\nliability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\\n1.15  Financial instruments \\n Financial instruments\\n Initial recognition\\n The Company recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the \\ninstrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables \\nwhich are initially measured at transaction price. \\n Subsequent measurement\\n Financial assets carried at amortised cost\\n A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold \\nthe asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates \\nto cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\\n Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\\n A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is held within a business \\nmodel whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual \\nterms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the \\nprincipal amount outstanding.\\n The Company has made an irrevocable election for its investments which are classified as equity instruments to present the \\nsubsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income based on its business model. Further, in cases where the \\nCompany has made an irrevocable election based on its business model, for its investments which are classified as equity \\ninstruments, the subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income.\\n Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\\n A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are subsequently fair valued through profit or loss.\\n Derecognition of Financial assets\\n The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or when it \\ntransfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party\\n Impairment of financial assets\\n In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of financial \\nassets other than those measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL). \\n Expected credit losses are measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:\\n• The 12-months expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from those default events on the financial \\ninstrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date); or \\n• Full lifetime expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the life of \\nthe financial instrument) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED101\\nCONSOLIDATED For trade receivables Company applies ‘simplified approach’ which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from \\ninitial recognition of the receivables. The Company uses historical default rates to determine impairment loss on the portfolio \\nof trade receivables. At every reporting date, these historical default rates are reviewed and changes in the forward-looking \\nestimates are analysed. \\n For other assets, the Company uses 12-month ECL to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase in \\ncredit risk. If there is significant increase in credit risk full lifetime ECL is used.\\n Financial liabilities\\n Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost. For trade and other payables maturing within one year from \\nthe Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\\n Derecognition of financial liabilities\\n The Company derecognises financial liabilities when the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired. \\n Equity instruments :\\n All equity investments in scope of Ind-AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading are \\nclassified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company decides to classify the same either as at FVTOCI or FVTPL. \\nThe Company makes such election on an instrument-by instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition \\nand is irrevocable. If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the \\ninstrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to Statement of \\nProfit and Loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.\\n Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the Statement \\nof Profit and Loss.\\n1.16  Earnings per share\\n The basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares \\noutstanding during the year.\\n Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue equity shares \\nwere exercised or converted during the period/year. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average \\nnumber of equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding at the year end.\\n1.17  Dividends\\n Final dividends on shares are recorded as a liability on the date of approval by the shareholders and interim dividends are \\nrecorded as a liability on the date of declaration by the company’s Board of Directors.\\n1.18  Standards Issued but not Effective\\n There is no such notification issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) which would have been applicable from \\nApril 1, 2020NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED102\\nCONSOLIDATEDCONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n(` in Lakhs)\\n2.

A fall in the discount rate generally increase the mark to market value of the assets depending on the duration of \\nasset.    \\nSalary Risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of members As such an \\nincrease in the salary of the members more than assumed level will increase the plan’s liability.    \\nInvestment Risk:  The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by \\nreference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will \\ncreate a plan deficit Currently, for the plan in India it has a relatively balanced mix of investments in government securities, and other \\ndebt instruments.    \\nAsset Liability Matching Risk:  The plan faces the ALM risk as to the matching cash flow Since the plan is invested in lines of Rule 101 of \\nIncome Tax Rules, 1962. this generally reduces ALM risk.    \\nMortality risk: Since the benefits under the plan is not payable for life time and payable till retirement age only, plan do not have any \\nlongevity risk    \\nConcentration Risk: Plan is having a concentration risk all the assets are invested in the insurance company and a default will wipe out \\nall the assets. Although probability of this is very less as Insurance companies have to follow regulatory guidelines.   \\nGratuity is taken care by separate trust fund and contribution is guided by rule 103 of Income tax rules 1962.   \\nThe principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows.\\nParticulars Valuation as at\\n31 Mar 2020 31 Mar 2019\\nDiscount rate(s) 6.89% 7.79%\\nExpected rate(s) of salary increase 5% p.a 5% p.aCONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS/nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED117\\nCONSOLIDATEDAmounts recognised in the statement of profit and loss in respect of these defined benefit plans are as follows. \\n(` In Lakh)\\nParticulars Year ended  \\n31 Mar 2020Year ended  \\n31 Mar 2019\\nService cost:\\n Current service cost  151.44  110.02 \\n Past service cost and (gain)/loss from settlements  -

Liquidity Risk\\nLiquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The company maintains sufficient \\nbank balance and marketable securities such as liquid/ultra-short duration and other debt funds.”  \\n2. Credit Risk \\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing financial \\nloss to the company. The company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business \\nactivities. The company has well defined investment policy restricting investments in various risk categories such high/moderate high/\\nmoderate etc.       \\n3. Foreign currency risk management:    \\nThe company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. \\nExchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.\\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the \\nreporting period are as follows.                                                                                                                        \\n(` in Lakhs)\\nCurrency Liabilities Assets\\nAs at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019As at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019\\nAED - - 7.73 13.23\\nUSD 18.81 44.44 866.81 622.97\\nBHD 22.95 10.28  -    -   \\nAUD  -    -   3.52 2.67\\nJPY  -    -   76.98 82.73\\nSGD  -    -   127.29 151.66\\n /nSBI FUNDS MANAGEMENT PRIVATE LIMITED124\\nCONSOLIDATEDCONSOLIDATED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nForeign currency sensitivity analysis:    \\nThe following table details the Company’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the Rupee against the relevant foreign \\ncurrencies. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents \\nmanagement’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding \\nforeign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency \\nrates. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or equity where the Rupee strengthens 10% against the relevant currency. \\nFor a 10% weakening of the Rupee against the relevant currency, there would be a comparable impact on the profit or equity, and the \\nbalances below would be negative.  \\n(` in Lakhs)\\nCurrency Impact on profit or loss for the year Impact on total equity as at the end of \\nthe reporting period\\nAs at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019As at  \\n31 March 2020As at  \\n31 March 2019\\nAED Currency impact  0.58  0.91  0.58  0.91 \\nUSD Currency impact  65.39  39.83  65.39  39.83 \\nBHD Currency impact  1.72  0.67  1.72  0.67 \\nAUD Currency impact  0.26  0.02  0.26  0.02 \\nJPY Currency impact  5.76  2.29  5.76  2.29 \\nSGD Currency impact  9.53  5.47  9.53  5.47 \\nIn management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk because the exposure at the \\nend of the reporting period does not reflect the exposure during the year and  considering the size of business and  size of  exposure \\nin Foreign currency is immaterial.    \\n36.
